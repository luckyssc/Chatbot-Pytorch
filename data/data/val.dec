speaking .

honey , you can ask him to be quite . otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
did somebody hit you ? or did you just fall ?
no way , mom . i don't like piano .
of course .
no more today , honey .
just go to read . i will find it , honey .
yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . if you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable .
where is my favorite white bread ? is it in refrigerator ?
they fit me very well . i like them .
could you do me a favor ?
it depends .
yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
i'm so sorry . i have no idea of it . i washed silk dress the first time . i'll buy a new one for you or i'll give you money .
6 yuan . and i can make them as new as before .
all right . i ’ ll repair them for you .
it seems i find the right place .
a table cloth of this size and style is 15 yuan .
there you go .
how about tomorrow morning ?
which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
no problem . do you need another film ?
his name is grunt . come closer and i'll properly introduce you .
purple . but today , i'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour .
may i have a try ?
you don't know what you are asking !
you are right .
there might be some birthday cake left in the freezer .
good , i will take the one hour facial with make up .
i loved it . i'll take it .
yeah . can i look at this ring ?
i hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for .
we're going over to mrs . smith's place to help her with her yard work .
oh , no .
not at all .
do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ?
my skin is kind of oily .
yes . we have all kinds of colors for it .
at least i enjoy my lunch ! what's in your bag ?
no ! my tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . now my engine is on fire !
in my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .
moon cakes ? what is that ?
where are you going to ?
i am really pleased with it .
i shouted it back of course .
anything that can keep my skin clean will do .
well . . . is that a pet ? isn't that something from the zoo ?
yes . you sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars .
it still feels really strange to me .
yes . look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ?
mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice i got was changing my eating habits . instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .
all the fruit are pretty fresh here .
san yuan .
if there's something wrong with it in a week , can i come back to change it ?
that takes some time .
we could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it .
no , this kind of cigarette is too strong for me , i desire a mild one .
ok . i will do that .
good morning , sweetie . you finally got up .
oh , no . i mean you look very nice in both of them .
it seems a little too wild .
here you are .
here will be ok .
please put it on the scale . where are you mailing it to ?
25 yuan by air , 13 yuan by sea .
yes , it is .
i'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day .
good . how much does it come to ?
what is your address , sir ?
well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it .
yes . you can take no . 846 from here , but you have to get off at nanchengmen stop and change to no . 106 .
that sounds good . today we work on legs and forearm .
that ’ s a good idea . the counselor is a psychologist . he ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things .
oh , she's good . she must be getting on a bit now .
i have to go to court . a cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there .
you'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .
yes , quite right .
that's right .
martini , please .
certainly . do you have your receipt ?
okay , here's a new one for you .
okay . enjoy your browsing .
have you found anything nice yet ?
i'm going to refund your money right now .
with pleasure . what color do you like ?
what is the material of this dress ?
you're lucky .
i'm doing it for fun and fitness .
it seems too short .
it looks nice . how much is it ?
it was at the beginning . you just need to keep it up .
yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
no problem , sir . but it will cost you extra .
no , sir . it's a genuine bonnet .
nothing else , thank you .
i'm just browsing , thanks .
well , i'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ?
yeah , it will become a wider trend .
here you are . thank you , bye bye !
i'm sorry i couldn't help you .
size 40 .
ok .
only 700 yuan .
hello , i come to pay my water and electricity fees .
how much can you drink ?
you just have to build up a tolerance . i used to be like that . but your body gets used to it .
yes , and seven days a week .
thank you . it looks very attractive .
later will do .
i am sorry , but i can't lend it to you now , for i haven't finished reading it . if you don't mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you .
where is it located ?
of course . it's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you cann't find the right place .
william . w i l l i a m .
800 yuan a month .
certainly . would you sit here please ? i'll call our credit manager .
sorry , my english isn ’ t so good . could you speak a little slower ?
i bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . my son played with it only twice and it broke .
good evening . we want a dinning room with a table for eight .
i've been using jim's old bike but he needs it back .
look at this mountain bike . it is only £ 330 . do you like it ?
i am not sure . i just can't connect to the net .
irish coffee is my favorite . but i'm not particular on it .
ok . anything else ?
very well , i'll try the banana flavor .
you know , sir , you don't have to use it . you can turn it on or off . if you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on .
alright , sir . i will get the paperwork ready for you . just a moment .
get used to it , mary . i'm off hamburgers for good health . most fast food is loaded with sodium .
we haven't decided yet . could you give us a little longer ?
can we get something to drink ? we want two bottles of beer .
i'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ?
yes , i'd like that , then .
it's two hundred and eighty dollars .
icecream , please .
i'll try the soya bean milk this time .
let's see . that would be ¥ 160 a day a mile .
ok . i like that green vegetable but i don't know how to call it .
yes . but i prefer a bit salty soup .
a small cola .
i'll have ham and egg with french fries . what dessert do you want ?
yes ?
sorry . you'd better get off for taking another taxi .
my pleasure .
well , i love hip hop dancing , so i should probably dance . do you know how to rap ?
no . sir , we charge separately .
i don ’ t understand . why do you want a cat ?
it's all right . kids are like that .
yes , do you have a table for five ?
oh , i'm sorry . should have been 2135 3668 , not 3678 . i've given you a wrong number .
yes , my table is for 7 and it's near the window .
my pleasure .
exercised over and over . exercise is a key .
the vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu .
i am washing clothes . are you hungry now ? wait for a moment , i'll cook dinner for you . ( steven bends his brows )
it's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room .
ok i will try it . do you have a small portion ? i am afraid i can't finish the large one .
anything to drink ?
here is the menu .
it looks delicious . can you tell me how to enjoy it ? it's my first time to eat it .
well , there are several kinds of steaks . for example , you can have your steaks medium rare , medium well or well done .
don't worry about your driving test . i think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon .
please bring me the chicken chops .
it doesn't matter .
i'm not sure . i know i should know that , but i can't remember right now .
what's this amount for ?
sending a message ' ktctwy ' to 10086 will do .
it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them .
thirty percent ?
that's sulphur you can smell . the whole of taiwan is a volcanic region . that's why taiwan has so many hot springs . it's volcanic activity . the sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there .
hold on , please .
yeah , i guess you're right . it's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . let's break out and do something completely different tonight .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques . besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower and bird painting .
do you have this shirt in a small ?
how much is this pen ?
does this suit come in other color ?
jingdezhen ? isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
it must be most precious .
i'm just looking .
thank you .
yes . ( after trying ) a bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . have you got a larger pair . size 39 ?
i want it short .
no , nothing of the kind .
shall i make out a receipt ?
we've got a bad line . can you repeat that please ?
i think it's my ankle .
we have a very wide selection of colors . and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . so it is very gentle on your eyelids . would you like to sample some ?
what colours do you have in foundation ?
yes . i'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow .
no .
here we are . that will be seven yuan and seventy cents .
could you drop us off on that corner ?
here is ten yuan . keep the change , please .
i'll be with you in a second . uh . yes , ma'am ?
with my dinner , please . and can you take my order for dessert later ?
it leaves at 8: 30 .
you will find a taxi stand the street corner .
but somebody told me this was the right bus to take . i want to go to tian'anmen square , you see .
take bus 12 and get off at the terminal station .
i haver run out of gas .
premium , please . by the way , please don't fill it up . two gallons will be fine .
just go through the no . 8 ticket barrier over there . a train will be in directly .
the four of us will be there at 7:00 this evening .
15 copies for each diploma .
cash or charge ?
that's absurd .
all right . wait a minute .
yes , i would like to return these slacks .
better take the subway . it's faster , and more convenient .
yes .
i'd like a little sugar , please .
may i have the menu , please ?
very good , we'll take them all .
$ 150 including the cloth .
really ? let me see .
of course . i will show you the fitting room .
good evening . would you please offer a table far from the entrance for us ?
it's my rock bottom price . take it or leave it .
i can tell you worked hard on it .
sure . let me measure for you .
one made in 100 % black barathea wool , with 5 celtic buttons .
what kind do you have ?
yes . i'll have the fresh fruit cocktail .
i'd like a hamburger with lettuce and tomato .
yes , i like the fish cooked in sweet and sour sauce best . try some beef , please .
yes , here you are .
just an english muffin . what are you going to have ?
let's see . if we have it , it should be over there under m . ( he looks through the cds . ) hmm , it looks like we've sold out of that one , but we should be getting some more copies in soon . if you want , we can order it for you .
over there .
well , let's try a size ten . ( he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) looks like a perfect fit .
ok , thank you .
of course .
oh , darn . look what i've done . ( spill the drink )
you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
do you think it will suit me ?
thank you . this one looks nice . is it near the university ?
hi , bill . i ’ d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday .
i am wondering if you do facial care ?
that ’ s true . we had an argument yesterday . she blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner .
okay . thank you for your reminder .
i am sorry . there is a speed limit .
can you please slow down ? i am not in a hurry .
blue .
no .
white rice , please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
across the street .
i said , ' do you need any help ? '
will you exfoliate the skin as well ?
may i ask if there's anything wrong with it ?
yes , we do . they're on the wall behind you .
what happened ? did you have a fight ?
great . here's my visa credit card .
well , why don't you go on a diet ?
sure , i used to work there . go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . the mall will be on the right .
we can be so critical of one another .
yes , i want to buy a suit .
it's at the back . i think you are near sighted . you had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses .
i am starting loving this bakery now .
yeah , but sometimes bingo wants to play with me , but i don't have time .
what color do you like ?
which one ?
it's under the table .
they're on the left side of the tv .
i think this suits me . can i try it on ?
about 20 minutes . do you live alone ?
i think so .
yes . what's this made of and how to wash it ?
do you feel better now ?
for my part , xiangqi . maybe it's because my girlfriend is chinese .
sure , why not ?
i had planned to . i can bring some from my place . and there's some more at my parents ' .
no , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . my phone should be working then , too .
it gives you money ?
will you lose all your files ?
hmm , it's a tough choice , but i think i'll go with this one .
that sounds great . i'll bring a bottle of wine then .
excuse me . i will go to wangfujing , where should i get off ?
yes . i'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please .
don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
oh , no . i forgot .
yeah . i turned around and started to move out . just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! i may sacrifice a little . let's fix it sixty five ! can't be cheaper . '
here it is .
i attend an aerobic class three times a week .
then what about tea ? we need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the chinese people .
more often than not , the understatement is ' i'm afraid it's time you leave ' .
i don't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west , the purpose is generally quite simple to savor the wine .
are you sure half past seven ?
it's here at last !
yeah , i know that . but at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped off .
an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ?
look at my cell phone . i can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . it's just like a pad .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
i think producers are underestimating the audience . they should think of better ways to entertain the general public .
it's 600 yuan per month . the rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . we ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . it will be returned to you at the end of your lease .
that's $ 1 825 .
well , we could eat in more often . that $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants .
that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ?
it can't be that bad .
what kind of errands do we need to run ?
i'll only go if we can stop at the office license to pick up something to drink for tonight .
i eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods .
about 3 000 dollars .
hum . i say 5 500 yuan . that's as cheap as it can get .
i'd like to buy a watch .
don't worry about it . tonight is my treat .
but a chinese person would never order that .
i'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
ok , i ’ ll see you later .
ok but you must stay calm . do you want me to give you a lift ?
you bet . almost all top brands such as mcdonald's and kfc are from america .
oh no . i broke your vase accidentally .
but look , it's so sunny out .
ok , shall we go to pizza hut or pizza italia ?
where's lisa ?
speaking . may i help you ?
hmm , let me see . boil some water .
if you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free .
would you like to put it on your hotel bill ?
may i have a look at your room card , mr . black ?
very well , thank you .
would you like some more ?
sure . it's 2331 7600 .
2244 forest drive .
i think i'll try it .
french , please .
okay , come right this way .
yes .
that's good .
i am sorry too . i know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend .
hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides , you and bob haven't seen each other for a while . i don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers .
yeah , i know , but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they won't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon .
yeah , i crave my own space . i just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . we all need our private space . but i also think interpersonal skills very important . living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time .
oh , four or five . how much is the rent for this apartment ?
that's all right .
thanks .
really ? you are so kind .
well , i've lost my wallet and my id card .
it's not what i asked for .
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
what would you like to have ?
ok , i'll go out and look for her .
what ’ s the number you are calling , please ?
yes . i need a tow truck . my car is broken down .
yes ?
thank you very much .
french dressing , please .
mmm , that sounds very interesting .
thank you very much .
that is very kind of you , mr lee . thank you .
thank you .
it's still early .
my pleasure , and have a good time !
ok . let me try it on . what do you think ?
but our younger sister is the apple of her eye .
if i had chance again , i'd major in english . you're good at language .
how much is it ?
you've got it , sir .
906 ottawa street . my name is david yang . my phone number is 713 786 0234 .
thank you very much . i have been looking for it for a long time . is this the latest edition ?
no , i'm not . i'm going to look for an apartment .
yes , they all stop at this corner .
you can take any bus except the number 9 .
well , you can take the no . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
i think watching them is a great way to learn english .
you'd better believe it .
bye .
hi , daddy . it ’ s me , troy .
i ’ m fine . is everything fine in the family ?
so how come it's still playing ?
certainly . go along queen's road .
what is it ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
okay . i ’ ll pay the charges .
she will be 86 next month .
i think i'll have two slices of whole wheat .
i ’ m calling from bell canada . we are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . with this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges .
( after arriving on time ) here's twenty dollars .
no problem . step in , please .
good morning . could you tell me the times of trains to london , please ?
return , please .
how much is a soft ?
the right side . iccc should be on the first floor .
ok . you drive and do be careful .
what's the matter , sir ?
but , sir , i didn't drink at all .
but i .
well , isn ’ t there anything you want ?
size 41 . i want something in dark flannel .
i quite like this one . how much is it ?
something awful happened . we went to the portobello road , and someone stole my handbag .
no , there ’ s no need .
it ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . that ’ s all .
no , thank you . i don't like soup . i'd rather have some fruit juice to start with .
it's the 11th avenue , park street .
is that the university next to the teachers ' college ?
where to , sir ?
it ’ ll take about 20 minutes .
i noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away .
we still prefer french dressing .
sure , let's take a look at the menu first .
what's the hardware ?
how about the price of the hardcover ?
oh , no . you should take the no . 14 tram .
yes . then cross the road at the next traffic lights . the peak tram is straight ahead . you can't miss it .
oh , four or five . how much is the rent for this apartment ?
okay , mom .
please tell me where your daughter's home is .
it seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .
can you accept a check ?
thanks , miss . i want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in .
hi , david . you are very difficult to reach . i called several times . but i kept getting a busy signal . is your phone out of order ?
alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop .
i know i could have . but finally we asked someone where we were .
how ?
i can never forget that . i bought you five candies , but i was so anxious that i forgot to give them to you . you didn't get them until we parted . then they had already melted down for i held them the whole time .
you can get killed . no kidding . remember , never stir up a hive .
yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time . and this will help us understand both better .
are you sure half past seven ?
sure .
oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ?
oh , my god ! no air conditioner !
ma'am , take your kid to school ?
i'm looking . can you still remember what the conductor said ?
oh , my god ! we get off at the wrong stop . i'm so sorry , honey .
thank you . how long it take to get my son's hair cut ?
this time included ?
honestly speaking , i think the one next to it suits you better .
she is 17 . it's for her birthday .
here you go .
wait , can you check these sunglasses i bought it in the second floor . i think they forgot to demagnetize it .
me too . daniel , look at your left side . can you see the air force ants ?
we plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates .
what happened ?
can we solve this later ? i am calling the insurance company .
sure . it ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . then , which one would you like ?
after that , we will have a picnic .
not really . but i really love to have after meal tea .
i'd like to see some traditional arts .
why ? do i have to order that ?
would you like to have a look ? is it to your satisfaction ?
i know . sorry , i shouldn't have rushed you , but i just couldn't stay at home and wait .
here we go .
we are nor alone here . so many other families !
i know that i should learn how to save more , but i hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes .
that was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . i think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .
sometimes , usually once every few weeks . do you ?
we ? do you want to go with me ?
what do you do there . hang around , like the kids ?
a two bedroom house in this area is generally around 250 , 000 rib .
i haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet .
it's ten after six . we ' re late . but dinner is at six thirty .
not really . her eyes are blue .
yes , sir . can i help you ?
if it is not to your satisfaction , i ’ ll certainly bring you another . but i ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes .
i ’ m afraid i ’ m not interested in fashion .
you've got it , sir .
now let me take your measurements .
no , i'm not .
oh , no , nathan , i . i really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . market prices are going to go up , and i think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
i ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
what did i do ? i haven't done anything .
no , i didn't . i'm innocent . those aren't mine . whatever you found is someone else's stuff . you can't prove anything . i wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff .
ugh . so how long is this going to take ? an hour ?
that ’ s it , my lease is up . i have to move .
no , make the second one with ham , pineappleand green peppers . oh , and make it thin crust .
just joking . i would like to get a few bottles of beer though . we also need a liter of cooking oil .
generally , the reporters take positive lines . they do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . in the classifieds , one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak japanese .
ok . i'll blow .
which tests do you mean ?
are you having any dessert ?
sure . come over here . as you can see , i have a wide selection of species . they can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . do you have a favourite colour ?
we eat it in my country too , but i wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket .
yes . he ’ s in hospital with a bad back . one morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . his wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . he ’ s been there for a few days now .
airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks .
about 7 thirty .
where are we ? oh , here we are . so we drive to the a120 and turn left .
yes , that's possible .
yes . first , you need to turn around . do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ?
it's a pity they didn't take the tele . we need a new one . anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company .
all right . let's go .
i'll do it later , dad . i must prepare the concert on saturday .
please , where do i catch the plane for new york ?
then let me see .
yes . it ’ s on this street . keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right .
i guess you are right .

i'm doing my best , grandma .
i know , grandma , i just .

it ' s an indian restaurant ! i know you have never had indian food , so i thought you might want to try .
you bet , emily . pull up a chair .
yeah , i don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . so there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ?

that's how much this t . v costs .

ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money .
it's hard to describe . they're sweet , but also sort of acidity .

they're like a citrus fruit .
the ones that are on sale are from central america .
oh , no problem . here's the lid that comes with the pan .

hello ? can you help me ? my computer ! oh man .
okay . do you have a particular size in mind ?
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
yeah , it sounds like it usually does when i start the car , but nothing else happens . the engine won ’ t start . should i maybe press the accelerator ?
ok , that ’ s all of them . no more gifts . now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?

it's clogged and water won't go down .
don't you wanna get it fixed now ?
ok , i will blow .
that's all right .
ok , i will take two bottles .
oh , yes , please . but you are just closing , aren't you ?
anything else ?
this is mary speaking . who is that ?
i know who we can ask . there is a girl i know , sara ralston . she is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . i know her from my church , and i trust her completely .
ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money .
i ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . do we need any meat ?
then what about tea ? we need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the chinese people .
i'll measure you . . . you take size 6 . what colour hat would you like ?
yeah , i know that . but at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped off .
she is also very naughty . by the way , do you have a dog , maria ?
oh , a cat ? come on .
oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ?
thanks . does the bar have a signature drink ?
it sounds interesting . i'll take one .
that's ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
in the playground , miss .
yes , i need to send the payment to immigration for my aunt's citizenship application . they won't accept checks . how do i send the money ?
you , too .
ok .
this saturday evening .
the only problem is that i'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
i hope so , do you have a shopping skirts ? something i could wear working in a ban ?
debit card .
what are we going to do now ?
sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? we ’ ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ ve got mary janes , ballerinas .
what ? you don ’ t know the first thing about gardening !
wow , this is nice ! ok , sign me up for both publications .
i was worried you would think it was too far to drive .
you just put quarters in the machines . it ' s easy .
i can't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ?
sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . you have to like the furniture .
got it . let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments .
yes , i would like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ?
yes , i almost slid too . alright . this tourniquet is tight . how does it feel ?
alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop .
oh , yeah ? it's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital .
i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read , you can .
it will be a piece of cake .
don't worry about it . it's just a drop in the bucket . that car has more scratches on it than i can count .
what is it ?
all right .
yes . we ’ re having a special sale on this machine here .
ok , what do you want me to do ?
my pleasure ! this tea towel ’ s a little ragged . do you have another one ?
hello . mr . higgins , please .
well , i think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week .
it's bigger than our last one . i've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .
the y . h . a . , mun . the youth hostel's association .
yes . thank you .
believe i will . look for me near the lake .
i ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
yes , it ’ s half price . it ’ s supposed to be too large that ’ s the fashion .
but there's no hot water after 10 at night . sometimes i like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good .
it isn ’ t too much .
certainly . as you can see , we have several three piece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are .
it is a bit of a fixer upper . let ’ s take a look inside .
it is beautiful .
actually , there is a problem .
i absolutely love the apartment .
i think i am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . here , feel how hot my head is !
i will be at the apartment today at 6
great . i'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ?
sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . they may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken .
it's still available . do you want to see it ?
yes , they are . i gave them a good clean . they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .
you ’ ll be lucky ! however , i ’ ll print out the information i got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
about ten days ago . i ’ ve tried to use it since then . sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating .
i know , i know . but i don't want any worms .
the rent is $ 1050 every month .
how does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
that ’ s amazing . the rent is very cheap .
well , not everyone wants to drink beer . make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . nothing ’ s as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day .
that sounds good , thanks , i'd like that . actually i'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
my hat ’ s new , too .
which glasses ? these glasses .
here you are .
i ’ m glad you understand .
i ’ m sorry , sir . could you tell me your name and order again , please ? i ’ ll check on the delay .
it's a chevrolet . why do you ask ? you going into the car business ?
how many rooms do you need in the flat ?
what happened ?
not yet . she's pretty tame . i think she must be used to being around lots of different people .
but it's a waste of money . you won't really run in them ! you don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . it's just a waste of money .
i really think you are stubborn about some things . but here . let's look at the new balance shoes .
do you want to try some of my yogurt . it's a favorite everyday dessert in greece .
sure . i'll just have a bite .
yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir .
no . i only want it to be a very good one . the best . it ' s a graduation gift for my son .
thirty percent ?
yes , i'm from taiwan .
sure , what is it ?
i almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on sundays .
aside from the sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad in the hole , or fish'n chips once a week .
that ’ s better . now what ?
why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
what did you in mind ?
i guess it is a little pricy .
your daughter usually does the dusting , and i do the vacuuming .
no . we have some that are different in style but not in color . they're over there . do you see the sign ?
i'm really sorry , ethan . i tried so hard , but i'm afraid i could't find a dutch restaurant in town . the best i could do was a german one about 15 minutes from here .
is it in a good location ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
oh , they look nice . may i try that back one on ?
oh , believe it or not , i came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food .
you do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
you didn't see the red light ?
how far do you want me to go ?
yes . it costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer .
my fault . i didn't realize what time it was .
sorry . that's not my fault .
i love apple pie .
what are you going to buy ?
i want some chocolate .
i have a sweet tooth . i want candy .
i changed my diet recently , and i eat a lot healthier now .
actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
how about some burgers ?
what do you feel like having ?
what are you planning on cooking ?
go right ahead .
that's what i ate yesterday .
okay , i'll grill some corn then .
has your prescription been filled yet ?
no problem . i'll do that for you .
it should be back on in the next couple of days .
we're going to give you a credit while the cable is down .
in that case , we'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice .
ok , i'll take one order of that .
do you have any house specials that you could recommend ?
i'd like that .
i already know . start cooking .
really ? why not ?
i've always liked green apples .
i really like how that sounds .
are there a lot of clothes ?
i started driving the bus a few months ago .
i already know , and i'll take care of all that when i wake up .
i really appreciate that .
del is the best choice .
i heard that a couple people got hurt .
don't you know that yellow means slow down ?
why'd you speed up instead ?
that's all right . make sure to look closely next time .
that's everything .
it doesn't cost me as much to wash here .
it costs less to wash here .
i'm going to clean it .
i already told you that i'm going to do it .
i'll remember to do that .
would you like anything else with your package ?
i'll send somebody over right away to fix it .
it's nice to meet you . thanks for coming .
is that all ?
yes , it is your choice as you are paying for it . make a wise investment and choose the best inspector you can find .
could you fill these papers out , please ?
yes , you passed .
yes , they accepted your counter offer , but they want you to pay for the home inspection .
i will call the owners right now . they will be happy to hear the good news .
what time would you like to take the test ?
use this one .
do you have your id with you ?
i'm going to do that as soon as possible .
why did you do that ?
what kind of bus pass would you like to buy ?
i think it'll be here pretty soon .
that's right .
very well . we have some fresh red roses .
you ’ re not going to get it .
you can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments .
you can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . otherwise , i will find another renter .
i will fax you a schedule as soon as i contact the owners to confirm the times .
adding in your expenses , i calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house .
how would you like to pay for it ?
bye bye . visit us again soon !
now , if you'll just sign here .
no problem . good luck
outlets usually give you great deals .
it's in aisle a .
can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking ?
rather difficult . how about you ?
they usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange .
you can buy them hard . wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel .
what makes you say that ?
sure , what ’ s up ?
i don ’ t know anything about it . soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
that's great . anything else ?
well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ?
okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
here's a similar aluminum pan . but it has a heat resistant handle .
yes , that one is very nice .
what are you going to look for ?
what store are you going to ?
i can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow .
oh my gosh , that one says temple city .
i won ’ t rent it if the faucet isn ’ t fixed .
i don't know . we may have missed our stop .
yes , it will .
there's a bus stop in the mall parking lot .
i'm positive that we missed our stop .
we can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra .
tell me about it .
that was smart .
i don't know ; it kind of looks like we did .
we appreciate your business .
do you have a problem walking a little bit ?
no problem .
you need to get off on fair oaks and washington .
that's all there is to it .
hello , this is the property manager . how may i help you ?
i'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
it'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass .
if you're in school , you can get a student pass .
it's $ 24 for each month .
the only thing you'll have to pay for is the monthly sticker .
really ?
that's where it is .
considering it wasn't what i ordered , it was still pretty good .
let me have a soda .
do you know what kind of beef you want ?
why don't you just get the basics ?
no .
remind him to give you a locker tomorrow .
he's going to make the opening speech .
just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
it'll start on lst september .
let's go sit in the back . all the cool kids do .
maybe . my parents moved to canada the year when i was born . we are living in toronto . suppose i might get a job in toronto when i graduate . it's too soon to say really .
i major in chemistry .
yes , i received the scholarship 3 times on end .
well , doctors are such an important job . i mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? i want to be important and help people .
of course . there ’ s always much to learn . i got to know more about the real world .
not just working experience . i would say the biggest lesson i learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .
yeah .
if the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , one is for admission , the others are for the aid .
why , jerry ? your words just came out of the blue .
sure . but it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
i doubt if i can pass it .
oh .
ok .
good morning , nathaniel . this is leah calling from the international student office .
and you think i fit the qualifications ?
what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ?
after six months , my college life will come to the end . the following trouble will be the job hunting . that's really a headache .
yes , just once .
sure . take a seat , please . what would you like to know ?
don't brother me !
i'm dead serious about this , sally .
hey , i worked hard on that report and i deserve the grade i got .
yes , i've been thinking about visiting you . i hope to get some advice from you .
that makes sense . so where is nicole ?
i guess that's because so many people drop out of that class .
really ?
wow , i didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history .
i finally begin to get to know harvard . it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor . i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard .
i got an a . sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so i don't know how i got a decent grade .
yes . definitely stay in the class . you will get a better grade than your test scores . he does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot .
school . since i was working part time , i had a difficult time keeping up with class . now that we have exams coming up , i'm totally freaking out .
i have fewer hobbies than yours . that's why i find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .
but i don't know how to play basketball .
thank you . that's a good idea . she likes exciting books . can you suggest another one ?
all you need is your student identification card to check out books .
ok .
first , i need a letter of recommendation .
let me see them . are these all the notes you have ?
next monday .
mark , this is lucy .
no , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
which university should i apply to ?
do you have a library card ?
i ’ m fine , celia . and you ?
it was great . i had a really good time .
well . to be honest , i usually sucked up to teachers because i wanted them to give me good grades . however , miss baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . she really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets .
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
that's good .
it costs 125 dollars a month .
do you mind if i ask you why you've taken the part time job here ?
really ? that ’ s marvelous !
yes , please .
listen , john . i understand that you are such an excellent student and i know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ?
got it . thank you , shirley .
that depends . some semesters have many , some don't . and some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . that's easy .
that's not the reason . i have to go to the english corner tomorrow evening . you know , i've been going there every week .
it's very helpful . the course has let me into a world of literature . i read so many great literatures .
yes , here it is .
you've got to be joking ! it's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so .
i wonder if i could enroll in it . i know it is a graduate course and i ' m a junior , but .
i know , but the geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field .
the next beginning class starts on october 25th .
from 7 to 9 o'clock .
it costs 125 dollars a month .
thank you , please fill out this form for us .
yes , i do .
my father wanted me to become a doctor , but i knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field .
i need help with something .
thank you so much .
there are several tiny countries in the world too . countries like monaco are smaller than many cities .
i need to check these books out .
well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ?
have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ?
what class are you trying to take ?
there is one class on tuesday and thursday from 2 to 4 .
that's a good idea . when you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone .
some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
he said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it's all good .
do you want to know something about the american character ?
you think ?
what is it ?
i'm majoring in english .
i'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . i like the culture .
i could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1
oh , okay . well , here you go .
our science field trip is next monday at 8 a . m . in the morning . can you mark that on your calendar ?
let's hurry . i'm starving !
great ! you are all set to enjoy the library .
you seem to have it down . have a good day !
i have no idea .
i want to return this video .
i would like to return this book .
i want to check these books out .
oh , i will .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
could you have gotten it done at another time ?
how are you going to catch up ?
he made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . do you know what i mean ?
the handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ?
are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ?
tell me the problem .
well , let me take a look at my grade book . how do you think you are doing ?
that shouldn ’ t be a problem .
you are very welcome .
here they are .
i get it . thank you .
that ’ s all i need .
that ’ s stupid .
i need to copy some pages in my book .
is there a maximum number of copies i can make ?
that ’ s okay .
thanks a lot for your help .
i forgot about that section .
does it always close at six ?
yes . i'm just waiting until i officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .
it ’ s great ! i ’ ve learned a lot form reading it .
thanks for the vote of confidence , justin !
i think i prefer face to face instruction better .
nothing .
just get out of my face !
leave me alone !
then , i might as well have them made .
hold it a second . i want to fix my hairpin .
sometimes it is . but after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out .
yes , they do . but you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription .
it ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls .
wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! okay , here you go . you are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start .
cardiopulmonary resuscitation !
i don ’ t have the slightest clue .
it ’ s from nyu .
i ’ ll just have to wait for ucla .
it is still a mystery to me .
that's a great relief . i was worried about him .
oh , that's how you see it .
no , i ‘ ve been waiting for ages .
yes , me too . i think i ’ ve lost some important clients recently because of this train !
he ’ s doing fine . a new broom sweeps clean .
oh , that ’ s too bad .
thank you . i appreciate the compliment .
my cigarettes .
i hardly dare call the police . they'll just laugh at us .
can you take he away from me ?
the boy is good for nothing .
why ?
oh , how were you saved finally ?
i'm very sorry . i didn't realize it . i promise i'll keep it down in the future .
no . i hate cell phones . but you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone .
no , it can't be . really ? who ?
you , too .
i know , i'm sorry .
anything you want . they have both casual and formal styles .
i bet . you must be stoked .
i accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . i'm really sorry .
and i got it on sale .
she's very funny . she makes me laugh all the time .
nothing . i just feel very lonely in this city . i miss my family .
thanks , mark . i used to be a member of the school choir .
well , you are flattering me . i wouldn't say i am a professional , but i did receive some training at school . my music teacher used to be a professional singer .
really ? how did you get the chance ?
we can't put up with it any more .
sorry . i'm just that i think i blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . i like totally drew a blank on everything !
martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that sara was just a friend . now , i have to explain to sara that i can't hang around her because of you .
well , compared with my wife , i'm just a beginner .
we are short of staff today .
hopefully , i ’ ll get accepted to ucla .
because i got my aa and now i am going towards my bachelor degree .
i graduated and now want to get a ba .
bob .
no . she was right . i was too nervous . i kept thinking , what if we blow it ?
zina ? zina the snake ?
yes . he's all nice and friendly to my face . but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back !
oh , how i wish this all wasn't happening !
yes , you're right . maybe there's any other reason .
oh , don't worry . i just killed a pigeon .
the last straw , huh ?
and i'm the one who put him there with my football moves .
no . i never sell my artwork .
pretty good . i ’ ve just had my new poems published .
forgive me darling . i'm very tired .
i really appreciated it .
i , ah . , i got have late .
this is all too fast . he's my best friend , and now he's gone .
no , i forgot to buy some .
i'll beat him .
thank you !
i do have the confidence , but i still worry about her .
yeah , i'm eager to learn chinese , but it is too difficult for me .
really ? that's really wonderful . i'm so happy for her .
keep your chin up . remember ? nothing is impossible to a willing heart .
but the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . i bet you'll soon turn the table .
not everything , but nearly . he speaks very clearly .
didn't i ?
it's super .
what ?
if that happen to me , i ’ ll take them back to the shop .
all right .
it's a private garden .
listen to some music ? and who ’ ll cook dinner ? will you ?
wow ! why so much ? i thought they were getting you an assistant .
but they are not as convenient as the subway .
i'm back . my bid on the buddha is still the highest !
thank you , i just tried my best . i am very happy to know you like it .
do you think bruce willis just drank a coke for his health ?
yeah , got a coke ?
it will do .
the last straw , huh ?
i am wiped out . thank you .
i know it would be more expensive . i think i could handle it though . it ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that i can ’ t get anything done .
are you done ?
no , thank you . i've had enough .
i am afraid this is the biggest size we have .
yeah , this one closes at ten . we could drive to the 24 hour store on sixth .
yeah , and the prices there are very high .
i couldn't agree with you more .
i am not in the mood .
it's very nice . i haven't heard live music in a while . this is fun .
i'll give you two clues . first , it cost more than $ 250 . and second , it's not big , but fat .
yes . what do you want ?
i guess i never thought of that before .
don't make a fuss . the price is rising
absolutely . she ' s a teacher of aerobics .
i'll teach you how to keep her .
cool ! flashy red lines !
you must be joking !
you're complaining again .
i'm not at all keen on that sort of job . it makes me crazy .
what is it ?
thank you . i have been working on it for several years .
what do the other people in your apartment think about them ?
i think so . maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here .
yeah , i've met her . she's a genius saleswoman !
it wasn't too bad . at lease i'm alive .
yes , do you like it ?
maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . he does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know .
so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
oh , don't mention it . it was terrible .
how about this blue sweater ?
well , anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation . the company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment .
what did you do ?
of course you can call the police if you want . that's not what i mean . i'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .
why ? i don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
i know , but i was so upset . i mean , come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor .
that's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor .
i think it is centrally controlled . they control it at the main desk .
yes . we had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf .
hi there mr . anderson ! how are you on this fine morning ?
did you happen to watch the football game last night ? the patriots scored in the last minute !
yes , i'm from taiwan . i never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car .
i see .
i'm just in the mood to act goofy .
why not now ? i'm hungry .
that's great . let's go !
oh , great ! i love it ! you know i've been expecting this for a long time .
congratulations , i hope everything works out .
me too .
yes , it is . are you here on business ?
is the pay good ?
but , bob , we were so good together .
i don't understand . we were getting along so well .
you asked for it .
i know what you mean . i could use a vacation myself .
are you serious ?
i'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers .
oh , i went on a holiday in the city of chende .
i try to picture the lord's face in my mind .
i could easily give you some time tomorrow night .
sure , i'd love to . i heard sichuan cuisine is very hot , i think i definitely love it .
what is it ?
how about mac donald's ?
i like peach blossom , because i like spring .
i will . bye .
oh , that scared me .
she said she wanted to go dutch in dating .
dress casually .
how many members are there in your forum ?
no . just occasionally .
to tell the truth , i don't like it . it's too fast .
so tricky !
it is beautiful ! look , there are so many birds around it .
i'm going to take more pictures today .
i love you , too .
coco lee .
she's at home .
do you want to bet ?
shandong .
good . why do people name it olympics ?
of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends .
figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it .
where is he going ?
what a pity !
that sounds great . where should we meet ?
i don't care . i need money .
thank you . i'm wearing make up .
okay . in the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see .
i'd like to , but i must run to a meeting .
really ? what a shame ! i thought she was going to win this one .
and did you like it ?
oh , excellent . why don't we talk in german for a while then ?
anyways , are you going to the party tonight ?
his girlfriend broke up with him .
this really has been a wonderful holiday for us . shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ?
really ? that's so great . congratulations .
maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
there are so many things you have to prepare for .
what ?
i always knew she was the one , but i decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . i'm just debating on how to do it .
it's really a small world , isn't it ! the hammer family isn't very big .
i just know i want to get out of the mindless gift trap .
that will work .
quite a lot . the celebration of the new year has just started . the first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the north have jiaozi . afterward , we will make new year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second .
do you know the day they plan to open ?
that's o . k . maybe his wife will spill the beans !
how fun ! can i bring something ?
yeah .
but it hurts too much .
you're right .
ok . i'll talk to you later .
i like your black clothes and your fangs are cool .
what's more , he said i was the hardest working person in the office !
isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about ?
i think the campaign is a blockbuster .
maybe . who knows ?
you gossip ! what's the basis of your opinion ?
maybe !
i've already got plans , too .
yes , it is .
to be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous .
i can tell it from your build .
i know . it's going to be so much fun .
it sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody !
yeah , but that's not why i am upset . i just found out another guy got a promotion . he doesn't know how to do anything . he sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long .
how about a cold bottle of beer .
did you watch nba games before you came to the u . s . ?
what a pity !
well . it's not all my fault , anna .
maybe you're right .
well , it's better than ' friendship first , competition second ' .
next week .
yeah , my name is nandu .
yes , you're right . what do you like to do in your spare time ?
just so so . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight .
oh , hi !
see you around !
there's nothing to watch right now .
oh yeah . i heard about that too . let's go check it out .
i joined the samsung health club last month .
bye .
nice to meet you , george . i'm irene .
oh , really ?
well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most .
i thought you were going to let it grow out long .
have you thought about wearing a hat ?
well , it's one way to get through the in betweens if you really want to grow it out !
not where , what . dutch means you both pay your own way .
oh , yes . i like playing basketball .
because i like the feeling of cooperating with others .
no , i didn't .
no , i rarely smoke . i don't drink , either . i only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends .
my whole family are going to hainan for visiting . what about you ?
yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face .
you like it , but it's getting to be a handicap for you .
i have no idea . to be honest , i couldn't care less .
are you sure ? he doesn't look that old .
on this occasion , most people do .
hi martha . everything is perfect .
i'm so happy . even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends .
that ’ s great ! i ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss .
whoa .
well , what do you want to see ? i don't think there are many good movies out right now .
personally , i'm not for it . i feel it's bad for kids to watch .
no , i'm afraid that's it .
i really don't like the winter . i wish it were summer .
i still have five seats in the mezzanine .
no , i'm still full from dinner .
i don't know for sure . when you get here we'll talk about it .
tom . you are her boss , you down . of course , she's helpful to you .
although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm .
what should i bring ?
it is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out .
great .
ok . i like fishing very much .
alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . but come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ?
yes . you should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .
i'm studying english , math , and history . my major is english .
actually , it's not that good . i can read but i can't speak very well . i haven't had a lot of chance to practice .
well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . what would you like ? orange juice ?
i am reading .
then what should i do ?
nothing really .
i totally agree !
oh , right , i hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there .
not if you pay for it . for example , if you download from itunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal .
my roommate invited both of us to dinner .
well . that's a long story .
so what did you do ?
i like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious .
o . k . see you .
tonight ? i'm afraid i can't . i've promised mark to go to the gym . can we make it tomorrow ?
not bad . but too hot for me today .
is this time one of them ?
what ’ s wrong ? that was a great goal .
yes . it was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now .
yes , it's so cold .
it certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .
today is may first , 2003 .
you see . money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities .
yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing i've ever owned .
thank you !
oh , my . what did you do ?
was it quite special ?
okay ! what do you suggest ?
as in english , chinese also has some lucky numbers . the number 9 stands for perpetuity in chinese .
no , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . but not too much . as the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart like raisins in an expanding dough .
ok . i will write to you as soon as i get there .
mmmm . ok , let's try to be .
ll
thx . bye for now . kisssssssssss .
yes , i try to keep in touch with them .
she's a real turn on , alright ?
no , not yet . why ?
no , i don't .
do you have to pay to join ?
i'm a bank manager .
we're happy together now . we both think that we're a well matched couple .
i think so . why did you ask that ?
yes , i have them with me . do you want to look at them ?
this one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter emily standing next to my wife .
i know , they look very similar .
the pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . i think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat .
come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games .
what's the second solar system ?
i agree . he is also an excellent speaker .
are you sure ? he is quite young , isn't he ?
do you believe what they say ?
yes , i'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
your feelings might be right . you should never walk alone there at night . it is too dangerous .
it's the fourth one this year . isn't it horrible .
yes . i moved here last week .
yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful .
i guess it is mrs hill . she sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary .
congratulations . but have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ?
i have to say you're a well matched couple .
sure . it's probably a skiing show . adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
i am very happy , too . it was a big game and i won .
really ?
maybe you'll only feel that way on father's day .
actually , i prefer if you didn't . air conditioning makes me sneeze .
in that case , i won't keep you any longer . drop in any time .
you've plenty of time yet . the railway station is very close . it won't take more than twenty minutes to get there .
call us as soon as you get home .
ok . do you have the receipt with you ? i think they will ask you to show them the receipt first .
you said it .
too easy questions . listen carefully . hollywood is the movie capital of the world . it is located in southern california . many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often .
no , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel .
i really love their dancing . they are all excellent dancers .
that's right . but i don't think there are better ways .
no , you must stay ! i swear it , and the oath shall be kept .
i ask you to pass through life at my side to be my second self and best earthly companion .
i never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm .
look at the candy bar over there . it is so colorful and tasty .
which one ?
what does she look like ?
what ? again ? why do you keep running out of money ?
true enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . i don't know where you're wasting your money but i think you need to take a look at what's really important .
have you got the ticket ?
we like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music . you can dance to heavy metal .
i'd like to book a table tonight .
western food or chinese food ?
very good .
i'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm .
because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
my pleasure . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer , and i suppose you dance often .
you can say that again . the sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze . it ' s so lovely .
so soon ? why don't you stay a little longer ?
that's simple . just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .
what's the matter ?
zzz means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , a / s / l is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . it's a three word question , ' age , / sex / location ? '
everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games .
of course ! i really love watching football games on tv .
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .
that sounds crazy . but they can't just change their mind about things like that .
what note ?
maybe some other time .
thanks . you too !
happy birthday to you ! i'd really love to come , but i'm not sure right now . i'll try to make it . thank you for your invitation .
i'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !
then why couldn't i get strike on the first ball ?
well , it's started raining since then . look out the window ! it's pouring rain out there !
there are clubs for beginners . it's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times .
okay .
are we going to walk or drive ?
ok , where and when should i meet you ?
that ’ s what i can do .
i'd like to , where ?
i had to look after my son at home .
don ’ t say things like this . please be confident . i think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore .
lily broke up with me last week . in fact , she dumped me .
ok , they begin to register .
i have no idea , any suggestions ?
fine . see you then .
is he beating mark ’ s time ?
not really , but i liked the design , so i got it .
yeah . why not ?
well , i'd like to , but i am not sure i have time .
yes , that's good . where would you like to go ?
no , i'm full .
which man ?
don't be silly , forget about it .
well , i like playing the violin .
that sounds really convenient . do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ?
great ! i will apply for a credit card when i go to the bank later .
what are you going to do now ?
i'll be there . oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ?
yes , i also felt that . i'm always busy , and have no time for rest . i don ’ t know how to make use of time .
oh , my shoes pinch me . let's find a seat and sit a while .
indeed . i love the smell of the grass and trees . they certainly refresh my mind .
no , it wasn't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars .
when is it ?
yes , that's right . you have a good memory .
he's a very creative painter . his paintings sell well .
honey , we're in the museum now . we're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . we're here to enjoy the great paintings by picasso !
it was fantastic , but i'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring !
don't ask such a question . you know it has no certain answer . everyone knows it is in his heart .
you bet it !
how can i ? they're as alike as two peas in a pod .
oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they're so scary .
it's amazing . but if i were you , i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
yes , thank you . i ’ ve already been helping myself .
my aunt mary just flew in from cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek .
well , i'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films .
no , we're not . we've been drifting apart for a while .
i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! she's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her .
i've given her enough time . i'm over it now .
let me think about it for a minute . let's see . oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! give me a second and it'll come to me .
see you . have a nice day !
sure , let's . goodbye , then .
don't worry about money . i'll treat you tonight .
how nice ! have fun !
did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ?
you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain .
you should . many guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
my immediate family is quite small . it ’ s just my older step brother , my mom , my step dad and me . how about you ?
yeah , many of my all time favorites were made in the forties . they've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time .
would you want to live there ?
i see . if you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?
thank you for saying that . it's a present from my girlfriend .
that's great . i would love to . and when ?
yes , that'd be all right .
what day is that ?
goodbye !
if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . if you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money .
that's annoying , but nothing to worry about .
we drove to the lake and had a picnic . we had a great time ! how about you ? did you do anything special ?
oh , i bet it's really quiet . but is there much to do there ?
so am i . the doctor says she'll get over in a month .
do you know what they are playing ?
and who is directing ?
what's the color of her eyes ?
don't be too critical . we can't expect it to be perfect .
you have lots of friends . they will be there , too !
how many best friends do you have ?
that's very nice of you .
okay . it looks like rain .
honey , please . you're the only woman for me , forever . i swear it .
oh ! ! my car isn't working . i'm waiting for a tow truck .
oh , i'm fine .
i am dying from the heat .
i don't know .
of course .
well , on saturday i cleaned the house and played tennis . then on sunday i hiked in the country .
which restaurant ?
well . i think iq matters more . but it won't work without eq .
did the cops find out why he flew into the u . s . ?
do they know what the robber looks like ?
brian ! how have you been ?
so you want to go to malibu ?
that is mary . i heard that she's just moved in with lee .
oh , that relationship is history . malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday .
ha ha , so you believe in astrology ?
i enjoy camping .
not so good . i have a terrible cold .
i have found myself a date mate .
i don't know the reason .

well then , i'll see you on saturday . thanks for asking me to go with you .
great ! i'll look forward to it . we'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .
mm . it's quite warm now .
hi tom ! i'm fine , and you ?
we'd better go out for a walk .
sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
me too . recently , i'm fascinated with net chat . i've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them . i really enjoy it .
have you heard of motor coaching ? it's one of the fastest growing segments for the travel industry .
not yet . i guess we should send jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . i am sure he can help .
right . what are you going to do tonight ?
it must be locked .
she can't answer you .
why don't you sit in the back with me ?
come off it .
why not ?
really ? when did that happen ?
but i still have to tell her .
is it ?
it was wonderful , but i was so tired .
pardon ?
yeah .
thanks !
no , it's so much worse . and tonight they invited me out to dinner . i really have no idea how i'm going to pull it off .
is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ?
thanks a lot . you are so kind .
shift it a little before you get up .
maybe it can take effect .
that ’ s all right .
i had my first cigarette when i was 17 .
yes . twice .
maybe we can come here again next summer .
hey , what's the time ?
kind of . it leads to my bedroom .
they're glad that i finally got a boyfriend .
well , i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds .
nothing much . i ’ m going to the cinema on friday night but that ’ s all i have planned .
private collectors ! they must have excellent collections . i'ii go and see each of them . what kinds of collections can i see ? come on , don't keep me in suspense !
yes . you always have a good nose for wines .
it ’ s beautiful but crowded .
yes , i have too much work to do at the moment .
coffee , please .

my father failed in business .

i ’ m starving , too . there is a new chinese restaurant close by . do you want to go there for lunch ?
mary told me that she had seen you with john last night . i got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
oh , i took a shine to him when we met for the first time . but it comes and goes .
easier said than done .
i'm sorry .
it's too late .
he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .
you're dancing so well .
ok .
hang on one second . hear me out , just this once , isabella !
he borrowed it from nick .
really ? good for you .
maybe he is trying to find a job . when he finds one , everything will be settled .
don ’ t be angry with me . i have a bad memory .
what day is it on earth ?
yes , it ’ s a small world . we never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know .
ho , no !
well , children usually resemble their parents .
excuse me , what did you say ?
that's incredible . i can't believe it .
you said it .
straight , i think , and about average length
didn't i ?
not particularly . i like a girl to be good .
yes , please . thank you for everything .
definitely . they don't take relationships and marriages very seriously .
and he ’ s bright and intelligent . i ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam .
poor boys ! they work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ?
that's terrible . do many people die in tornadoes ?
hi . it ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ?
no . i'm just killing time .
we go way back . we ' ve known each other since we were toddlers .
what a lovely dog ! how did you know i love things like this ?
no , i have no complaints . i hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ?
yes . i like it very much .
my name is jane brown !
quiet everybody !
no , i traveled for a while in europe after college , and then i lived in france .
how about i come and see you off ?
yes , i was . you work for 3m , right ?
on my first trip i went to tokyo , and on my second trip i visited kyoto .
morning sally ! what's up ? you seem in a hurry !
do you need help setting up or anything ? i don't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
i know that . i met her last week , and she looked as pale as death .
that ’ s too bad . she ’ s been so kind to us all .
he is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time .
pretty good . listen . have you heard about the new thai restaurant over on university avenue ?
it it true of many countries .
i absolutely agree with you .
i ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones .
it ’ s great . although his father didn ’ t agree with that , tom went through with it .
but i think time can change everything .
fine ! how are you ?
i ’ ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help .
really ? good for you .
sorry , i didn't think it mattered .
oh really ? is he all right ?
yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
i think we would be able to make it . what time shall we come ?
to new york .
i usually take the five thirty home .
you can see it tomorrow .
very much . new york is such a nice place . shall i show you some photographs ?
no , don't try to tempt me . i'm becoming chubby , and i have to slender down .
i don't think so . i know i've put on weight this winter .
oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it .
ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return .
oh , it's so quiet here . we have the park to ourselves , only you and me !
she will be 86 next month .
and three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
you will .
speaking .
what would you like to drink ?
just fine , and you ?
i like taking photos out of doors .
yes , is that you , allen ?
not so well . to be honest with you , i broke up with tom .
yes , the weather sure is nice today .
i'd be glad to tell you what i think .
don't mention it . it was the least i could do .
i don't know . it ' s still up in tha air .
we'd better go out for a walk .
it ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others .
that ’ s right . but i don ’ t think there are better ways .
no . but my husband smokes 20 or more a day .
take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch .
maybe . but you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account .
was it ?
i'm glad you like it .
i know i was an idiot , but if there is anything i can do to make up , please do tell me .
well , you always say you're busy .
not really . i couldn ’ t careless about the olympic games .
and it ’ s so much fun . one day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
really ? why would you worry about me ? i ’ m just fine .
yes . we enjoyed ourselves very much . have you traveled much , luke ?
no ! so . is halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ?
well , every department is different . you wouldn't want your new co workers to think you're a grinch , right ?
that ’ s right , or i ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking .
oh , definitely . i remember , when i first arrived in guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
it's an old superstition . if we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . can andy bring a date ?
my feelings exactly .
well , i believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ?
i just found out that my husband is cheating on me .
i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years .
why ?
i see .
fine , thank you . and you ?
yes . i have been here for three years .
i lived in england when i was a child .
the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options . but bob didn't want to play that game again .
now he only works freelance . hundred bucks an hour .
i really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek .
ha , she is unstoppable . i'm learning so much from her .
i really liked living in australia . i was an international student and i studied education at the university of sydney . and living in sydney was fantasticbecuase i could go to the beach anytime i wanted and there was a great nightlife in sydney . there are lots of great clubs . and people were very , very friendly and easy going and i met a lot of international people in living sydney .
i was there for almost a year .
and where would you get a cup of cappuccino ?
well , i suppose people have different tastes on music . moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . it takes time for people to accept new things .
sure . that makes a good fan . do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ?
sounds pretty good . what about the charge ?
no , nobody .
that ’ s all right .
i don't know . it's still up in the air .
i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life .
that ’ s my wish .
do you know what they are playing ?
fine ! how are you ?
ok , see you .
i like taking photos out of door .
i like blue . you see , that's the color of the sky . i wanna be a superman .
frankly , he is more well behaved than you .
what is a back packer ?
he lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later .
he used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him .
oh , quite the other way round . she is a knock out . she devotes much of her time to her career .
and he's so handsome .
i really couldn't understand him .
yes , she does . she works at home .
i've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business .
i think i'm getting a heart stroke .
yes , i want to be her boyfriend . just like in the movie .
irish coffee is my favorite . but i can drink any other . i'm not particular on it .
exactly . nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ?
yes , well done . that's the way to go . how clever you are ! you've got it .
that's right . but the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming .
exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
yes , whenever i think about china , i'd see the tian'an men square . china is a very beautiful country . and i've seen many landmarks in china but i like the great wall most .
was it built before the in dynasty ? i thought it was in the ming dynasty .
do you know other famous animals in the world ?
we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth .
i suspect it's unavoidable .
i know . but things have changed . i guess i've settled down .
he spoke evil behind his back .
i'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
she is now in a private school .
i see why it lags behind other towns .
that ’ s why many people look up to him .
i don ’ t know .
yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . you can have my us dollars , i don ’ t need them .
really ? i was quite good at the hurdles and the discus .
i came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but i never won . did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ?
sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare .
i think we should do a few things at once . improving public transport would encourage people to use that . if we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much .
i like basketball . i really enjoy watching the nba games on tv .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries .
that ’ s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
i know what the characters on the paintings mean . i think chinese characters look very artistic . it ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character .
their family is very similar to cindy and ron ’ s family .
i don ’ t mind , but i like girls with long hair .
not so well . i've come down with the flu .
yeah . how are you these days ?
i'm a teacher .
very much . new york is such a nice place . shall i show you some photographs ?
thanks . do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ?
actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .
doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . do you want to come here ?
they use said it
yes . it could happen .
absolutely . take my word for it .
they had almost every kind of seafood . there were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . i ate a lot of smoked salmon .
that ’ s a good idea . you are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job .
well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . i mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ?
she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . when she uses it , it makes a funny noise .
i ’ m ready looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast !
yes , it looks interesting .
maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
what's her figure ?
my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ?
oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
back to live with my parents . that's something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
we still prefer french dressing .
oh , you've got a good memory .
it's gone with the wind .
of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer .
i'd like to . but i'm not myself today .
it's the end of the world for me .
it doesn ’ t make any difference to me .
you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .
you mean armistice day .
thank you . wow , your school has so many honors . congratulations !
let me know if i can help .
no , not really .
a new car ! you're kidding !
ok , ok . i'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone !
hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns !
yep . and it breathes , see !
and so i bought all these books on having kids and .
oh ? i heard she dumped you . anyway , she's right over there . oh , sheryl !
your boyfriend , bryan , wanted to toss the football . i think he wore me out .
you're like the tenth person to say that .
great . my face will turn even redder !
i'll take over for a while to give you a break .
i'll take one . how's the cooler situation ?
there's barely any contact in touch football . people just tag you to stop the play .
yes , it sure is . i had to run here from work ! i need to rush as i'm on my lunch break .
that's great news , jeremy . congratulations ! anyway , i must get back , but give my regards to your wife monica .
pick up lines don ' t work !
really ? are you sure ?
yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .
i ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that i will have a passionate summer fling !
let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !
ok !
that ’ s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia , except me . there are a few south koreans , several japanese , malaysian , thai , singaporean , filipino , kazakhstan , and one russian .
yes ! yes ! and yes ! jared , of course i ’ ll marry you !
i ’ ve been playing computer games .
well , i don ’ t know .
well , i would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday !
well , we can't break tradition ! it's bad luck !
i sure do . in my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home .
you ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , i ’ m leaving .
gravy ! jim is such a jive turkey man . he is always hitting me up for cash . anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ?
duh ! i would say yes ! eric is the most popular kid in school ! okay , my turn . what would you do if you won the lottery ?
he ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes .
no , thank you . i think i can handle it .
i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ?
good .
thank you .
of course . i will .
i think i ’ d like to do that . i could take the things i learn here back to my country when i have finished my studies .
it is in mine too . the biggest issue is water . the climate is dry and so water conservation is very important .
according to the book , it is . i ’ ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air , it looks like a square with a semi circle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ?
it could be . there are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent .
it ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . government policy is to conserve those forests .
no , but i have to type my paper tonight .
no , i was out . was it worth watching ?
coke is fine . thank you .
how nice of you to remember !
i'll stay at home and have a complete rest .
you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but last time i saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . i saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . is it open now ?
i'm afraid i have to leave . i have to be up early tomorrow .
can you stay a little longer ?
why not start with the most interesting one ?
ok , i will bring you photos as many as possible .
i'm having a hard time getting the information .
but you promised to play chess with me this afternoon .
are you sure ? he is quite young , isn't he ?
not really . i could take it or leave it .
how can you do that ?
i will . see you later .
you can trust him . he always tells the truth .
pretty well . i think the boss liked my ideas .
providence , rhode island . do you know it ?
well , i am from canada . actually .
about 18 years , i started learning when i was a kid .
well , i go to the gym a lot . i am a member of a gym nearby .
from my own experience as a career woman , i would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks .
affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world .
it's great ! the mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular . have you been here for a long time ?
wow , talk about job perks ! that's great . i would like to do something exciting like that . but i am only an accountant . not too much excitement there . huh ?
yeah , i really got a lot of the session . the workshop topic was resolving personal problems . it was led by a professional human resources director . the teacher had a lot of experience , and i think we were all given a really good base to start with .
isn't that a good thing ? having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ?
oh no , ari . i didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when i invited you to go tonight . let ’ s go dutch . i ’ ll pay my own way . i insist .
same problem here . there's an 18 year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .
huh ? i can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud .
las vegas . i find gambling relaxing . i don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . besides , i love the shows and the all night atmosphere of the town . the casinos never close , you know .
don ’ t worry . you can take night classes . i did that when i had kids . and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . then you could find a job and work .
oh , i see . you know , we spend time doing different sports . how much time do you spend exercising ?
so that's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ?
not much . just sitting here eating some chinese food . is that the paper ? why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
that sounds bad ! i'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
well , we have the thompsons , the greens , and the anderson , about twelve people total .
when i ’ m home in the states , i go , but not in china .
i think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea .
yes , in many ways it is . there are many stereotypes i have to deal with in my daily life .
you know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise .
in summer i go hiking , and in winter i ski .
what are you reading ?
i don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
merry christmas ! mr bean .
if your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened .
oh , really ? i go to the rye every day .
i don't know .
oh , if i hadn't moved here i would never thought of changing it .
he's over sixty .
are you going to take your children along ?
yes , the autumn is marvelous here .
he must be very brave .
not yet , grandma , what's the matter ?
i'll finish soon .
her acting is ok .
hell with it ! nobody will give it an academy award !
well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
why not start with the most interesting one ?
james cameron , of course .
just look around ? nah , that ’ s boring .
yes , but not fluently .
thanks , i will . i'll see you tomorrow then !
oh , i was out sick most of last week . i ’ m still not completely over it . you ’ d better not get too close !
froth ?
let me see it ! it's so small !
those poor egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit !
20/350 .
wow ! it's a trivia game all about the academy awards .
sure , i have . will you join ?
thanks for inviting me . here is the gift for you . happy birthday , francis ! many more happy and healthy years for you !
it ’ s my pleasure . i enjoyed working with you .
then keep up the good work .
it ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but it ’ s the evening rush .
but whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls !
yes , i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon .
i will think about it .
you mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models . hello ?
oh , i no longer work there . i'm working with a multi national corporation .
so decode this for me , madame psycho .
you bought a compact car ?
yep . and it breathes , see !
yes , it is . look at the little light ! it blinks off and on .
well , i prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? it tastes great and very healthy too .
you ’ re welcome . it was good seeing you again .
well , of course i can ’ t miss it . which team are you for ?
bye .
one more thing , keep your desk neat . it's the rule . there is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat .
i ’ m sorry i can ’ t make it . thank you anyhow .
yes . i am going for a hike around the qinghai lake .
well , we come here almost every month .
yes , i tried it and i quite liked it .
good morning mr . li
i love flowers you know . thank you very much .
do you like watching football matches ?
just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in .
right !
really ? he looks so young .
well , i like to play the piano .
i will , do you want me to bring anything ?
it's certainly a tight schedule .
six thirty , tonight .
hi , i ’ m susan marshall , you can call me susan . nice to meet you .
my name is zhang ming . nice to meet you , susan .
business management
when i told david i was coming here to live , he give me your number , and suggest that i give your a ring . i was wondering if you could give me some advices .
just asking ? ! why is your face burning like mad ? ah huh , someone has a crush on jenny , doesn't he ?
i will . bye , mom .
it sounds nice .
that's 35 yuan each .
tarzan .
i am afraid not . tomorrow is premiere .
the ending is a bit weak . it's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories .
actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ?
yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
well , i am really surprised . by the way , have you done anything behind my back ?
i've tried , but it didn't work .
ok , then .
why do you say that ?
ok , got it . i will call you sometime next week .
thank you .
well , you really do have a talent for this , alice . thanks for the suggestions .
i teach mathematics at a college . what do you do ?
no kidding . not only can ’ t i stand the pain , but man . dentists are expensive . the bill is going to be humungous !
it is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
there were six of us .
which one do you like best ?
good morning , emma ! a lovely day , isn't it ?
have you ever seen a hurricane ?
and the streets are covered with snow .
how about you ? what are you going to do tomorrow ?
you mean mary ?
good for you ! you ’ ve got new curtains too . that ’ s a very nice shade of blue . this sofa is very comfortable . i could sit on it all day !
mike suggests me to return it .
well , i have a guest pass . why don ’ t you come with me tonight ?
i really can't say . both teams this year seem really good .
me , too . i've heard so much about you .
definitely . it not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul .
have you ever been to it before ?
keep it . i'm buying tonight .
i think mutton is best .
yes , i have . but i have to wait .
sure . speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? you know , i'm planning a tour to jiuzhaigou valley .
not really . to be honest , it's very cheap . i only spent $ 100 .
yes , it is .
yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too .
i want to study mandarin and public relations .
well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan .
not bad . let's find a table and sit down . we have a lot to talk about .
well , maybe when i get old . but first i'll be a lawyer .
that's wonderful . congratulations .
what day is that ?
i hope so , too .
just two blocks away , in that tall building .
no , i ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from beijing .
she ’ s a librarian at the public library .
see your problem ? you get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down .
i think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building .
well , i just think he deserves it .
i'll try to speak more clearly .
to tell you the truth , it was completely accidental .
why doesn't he meet us outside ?
that ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! you can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! especially with clothes or jewelry . on top of that , i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like !
so , what are you saying ? you ’ re breaking up with me because i ’ m perfect ?
i made strawberry shortcake .
it's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
i'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend .
that ’ s a great idea . which charities would you support ?
yes , i am . i enjoyed studying it at school , though i had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ?
you ’ re back already ? the water was too cold , huh ? i ’ ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ’ ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some
ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !
take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch .
i wish we hadn't come up here . now we'll probably be here for days .
oh no ! not a good swing at all ! it ’ s definitely not his day today . on the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . he will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .
what were they doing when you called ?
no , i think you deserve some recognition here ; i mean , if i look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement .
what ? why ? can ’ t you renew it ?
nah ! this is boring ! i ’ m gonna go play killer zombies on my playstation !
well , that ’ s just it . it did have some very dramatic and intense scenes for example when mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of scar . even so , the film is linear . mufasal dies , simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . it ’ s just too cliche .
brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .
well , first it is important to go through a good stretch . you must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines .
it is . we study hard all week . and then , on the weekend , we party hard . that's the best way to live .
wait , jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . put a hat on !
sure . but , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . have you been hiking before ?
no ! the egg came first !
maurice richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie !
nothing . he's just got a chip on the shoulder .
not at all , i was totally in the dark .
that's okay . i can explain a little .
if you want . didn't you buy her a small vase already ?
let's go ask about it .
whoa , don ’ t you remember ? last year when i set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ?
oh great ! does this mean that the reception is canceled ?
it's true . i would never go there again either . country music is a nightmare . so is it the latin club ?
oh , yes , it was very interesting .
maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . i've been wanting to try a new place anyway .
i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities .
absolutely . i can decide when and what to do all by myself .
awful . it was a complete waste of time .
sounds good . where are we going ?
yy's ? that place is boring . how about xara's ? it's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span .
i can just use my beach towel . i love lazing around in the sun .
i can't wait ! it sounds like we're going to have a great time . how much money should i bring ?
ok , where and when should i meet you ?
when i was young , my parents took me to the one in california . i always forget which — is that one disneyland or disneyworld ?
i'm sure he'll love the idea . just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too !
i would like that anna , but i think i ’ ll need a little space for a bit .
i heard they were just married for 5 months .
yeah . mixed marriage is tempting but crisis ridden .
how long have you been in to pop music , then ?
who else is going to be there ?
so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?
say hello to your friends for me .
what do you think would make you happier ?
that'd be great . what kind of camera do you have ?
no , i can handle it . thanks anyway .
i'll get you for that comments , george .
it wasn't as good as you think .
the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap .
to be honest , i was just dumped .
yeah , i think so .
that's fine with me .
well , skip over all of that and read me the rest .
i had no idea there were a set of instructions . i thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses !

i don't have time to talk to her now .
yes , i'll see that you get those delivery . shipping by ' s . s . american ' as usual , is that all right ?
well , what i can tell you is this . we've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . so they're not only shockproof but also dampproof .
so sorry to hear that . what's wrong with you ?
that's exactly my understanding .
sorry , could you repeat that please ?

well , i am sorry that i have a question . there is no remuneration item in this agreement . can you tell me something about it ?
okay , i can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . can you give me some time to think it over ?
can we add up this item to the agreement ?
that is guaranteed . each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping .
our goods are well examined before shipment . i'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route .
i have learned a lot about business know how and basic office skills . in addition , i learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues .
i haven ’ t been involved in international business , so i don ’ t have any experience .
all these say a lot for their characters .
it is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation .
thank you again !
i felt dizzy when i stare at those shining lights . what should we do firstly ?
let me see the notice . it is here . our booth number is e108 . good number .
my expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 rib range . that ’ s the take home pay .
i must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance .
i think the plans look good . there's just one thing though , i'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . what's the height clearance ?
i'm nervous . i have to make a big presentation in the meeting .
goodbye , lucy .
yes , is there a coffee machine around here ?
yes , you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning . then , you have a lunch appointment with mr . clark . and this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants .
i've noticed you've been working overtime a lot .
the motor vehicles division . i work in our belgian factory . we manufacture components for our car production plants in europe .
yes , i think she will .
well , there are several reasons . i don't think my present job is suitable for me . that's the first reason . secondly , your company has a good reputation . i think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . last , frankly speaking , i wish to get higher pay .
you have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time .
oh , am i seeing mr . li ?
i am afraid i can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the board of directors at half past four .
yes , do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
yes , i do .
that's a pity . does friday suit you ?
how do you do , mr . zhang ? i'm glad to meet you .
could you tell him that horst weissmuller phoned .
to start with i would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time .
do you know what you will be doing yet ?
your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
i've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . your goods are all far above standard quality .
ha , i know you are great secretary .
good bye .
that will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike .
only english .
many exporters speak french and german as well .
my name is steven . i'm the sales manager of this company .
oh , i'm sorry about that .
yes . to develop my knowledge , i studied economics , business administration and accounting through self study . nowadays , i have passed three courses on cpa .
when do you expect it to be finished ?
i passed college english test band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . i haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because i don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . i think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . and i am quite familiar with microsoft office .
thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn .
we'd like to visit the factory . can you show me the way ?
yes . they have been laid by their name cards on the meeting table for each attendant .
but you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . you can get much information about environment of investment .
i think i am very good at planning . i manage my time well so that i can always get things done on time .
i have a doctor license and a driving license .
i passed both the cambridge examinations ( first certificate and the certificate of proficiency in english ); and studied for a year in london at the lucas secretarial college , ending with speeds of 120 words per minute in english shorthand and 50 words per minute in typing . i was also trained in office procedure .
why don't you go over the resumes again ? they might help you decide who to hire .
send it by the fastest way .
yes , this runway is going to sparkle with glamour and style !
yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . you're well informed . we'd like to build new factory .
delighted i was able to help .
yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
that sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ?
i'm on my way .
that's a lot to sell with very low profit margins .
it's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country .
it's my pleasure . how many copies would you want ?
of course . i've loved writing since i was a very little boy . i won the first prize in a national composition contest when i was in middle school . after attending nanjing university , i never give up writing . my works , such as father's tobacco pipe , open air cinema , the old city were respectively published china youth daily , yangzi evening news , and new beijing . during the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , i paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . the impact of internet in chinese political participation , the discipline of remold , the historical direction of chinese administration reform , bribery cases of self governance in chinese villages are respectively published in chinese publish administration , beijing due xuebao , theory and society and chinese reform . i joined in yangzi evening news to work as a part time journalist in 2006 . during this period , i've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , i have full confidence in my writing ability , and i believe i can do the job well .
i think i ’ m tough not only physically but mentally .
here it is , sir .
yes , sir . i acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
yes , you are right . after all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . the only problem is price .
our silks are known for their quality . they are one of our traditional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . they are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand .
well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that i think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person .
yes , my college teacher was an australian . she was also our adviser on our english language newspaper . i was the editor for two years .
fine . thank you very much .
i will try my best to assist you if you need any help .
so ?
yes , it is . but we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . why don't you come in and fill out an application ?
i can type 120 words a minute and i take shorthand at 80 words a minute .
i'd be glad to answer any questions you may have .
when will we get one of those ?
i get it , and thank you for your honesty .
i'm quite outgoing , i think .
i wouldn't call myself extroverted . sometimes , i enjoy being by myself very much . but other times , i like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years .
have you done any work in this field ?
this job is more challenging and i have longed to be a translator . that ’ s why i came here for an interview .
i worked as a personnel manager in a state owned company , and then i transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the exile market in china .
thank you very much . bye bye .
i would like to ask for four point five million hong kong dollars .
you ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self confidence .
yes . ah ! i forgot to include my e mail address .
my pen name is ' dark blue ' .
from 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m .
i speak english and french in addition to my mother tongue , chinese .
oh , no . it was easy . your office sent me a map .
same here . i've been looking forward to this .
there are three people in my family .
yes , i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished it by this morning . it was so difficult !
civil law . because it is broad and profound , and furthermore , it best reflects the spirits of fairness and equality .
yes , mr . miller . we'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting .
of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . you can have a look . we also have many other kinds of carpets .
really ? how did it go ?
you get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable .
i won't be too long , i suppose . just let me ring them , will you ?
that's right . let's go into details of it .
they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in .
i'd like to , but i'm afraid that my schedule is full this week .
well , i'll consider the possibility . by the way , when do i have to open the l / c if i want the goods to be delivered in june .
yes . what can i do for you ?
what ’ s your name ?
i studied at anshan university .
then when will i get a reply at the latest ?
yes , i am . that's why i make plans before i do anything .
i got it . thank you so much .
of course . generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience .
i wish i could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market .
what kind of price did you want ?
i'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot .
also several copies of your one inch color photos .
aspirin .
i think so too , and you have a general understanding of the company now .
yes . i am sure i can . i was an english major in college .
ok . thank you very much for telling me all these things .
i ’ m afraid he's not in .
yes , and you must be james . it's nice to meet you at long last .
you are excellent .
yes . i graduated this past june .
yes , i had taken finance courses in a training school . compound talents are needed in the society and i must study continually to keep abreast with the times .
i think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life .
no , i don't . either i shape up or my job is on the line .
yes , that's right .
hello , everybody . i am monica and this is my first day at work . i am working in the finance department . i am very happy to meet everyone and i am looking forward to working well with all of you . i am very happy to be one of the team and i will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . by the way , call me monica . everybody calls me so .
whatever the result is , you should keep your good demeanor .
i have a little problem , i'm overweight for my height . i think i should go on a diet .
in the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview .
thank you . oh , it tastes nice .
sure , company rules are not very strict at this point .
never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed .
sorry , i don ’ t know the rule about punching .
do we also need to punch out after work ?
you certainly made a good impression on me as well .
no problem .
my name is bruce green .
thanks a lot .
we'll take great care .
has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ?
yes , of course . if you make an inquiry , we can make you a firm offer .
all this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues .
oh , yes , i'd very much like to go .
i certainly did . do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ?
well , i know you are pretty busy these days . but we have got to work fast on this . otherwise , we'll lose the market .
5 000 yuan per month .
all right , mr . green .
where is it ?
this is liu fang speaking .
sure , no problem . do you want me to edit it for you ?
because the job i am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but i like challenge . your firm is a young organization with many innovative ideas . it has been very successful in expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge i am looking for .
the internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
yes , do you know the nine to five timetable ?
yes , i will . have a nice flight back .
it's really of nothing .
job intentions refer to the kind of job you are eager to get , for example , accounting , marketing .
yes , speaking . how can i help you ?
i think he should be an expert of everything .
do you know various funds and accounts ?
is there anything else i should do ?
is there anywhere i can reach him ?
well , i will do it better .
the note says you should call your manager first , and then tell him your reason , and then ask him for the approval .
i know you , zina . you're only nice when you want something .
yeah , is that all ?
oh , my god , is there any fixed for mat for it the one that i just need to fix my information in ?
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
ok , i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you . however , i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
and every best wish for your new job .
6 . so we should give them special attention . some of them don't have a good health .
do i have to travel a lot ?
but how will i get to know the products ?
well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward .
i have a b . a . in economics .
how long do you think she'll be ?
i have a plan for handling webtracker . step one is the stars . com contract .
wilson .
what about your accounts ?
i can't do that , zina . you know i can't .
and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
well , unfortunately i have got something to do this weekend . but let me see .
i'm afraid we have to reschedule it .
this is he speaking .
oh , really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
how do you do , mr . smith ? my name is thou hong .
oh , that sounds terrible . would you be happier with higher pay here ? i'm sure something can be worked out .
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let's meet each other half away again and split the difference ; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
can you tell me how many you want to buy ?
yes . we're satisfied with the result .
they describe how each process goes on to the next .
glad to meet you .
thanks a lot .
this is kevin .
i'm from germany .
someone told joe off .
yes , i ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications .
we assure you that shipment will be made no later than the first half of october .
in 2004 , i got a job in the sales department of a trading company near guangzhou . i started a sales representative . a year later , i was promoted to the position of sales manager . i had that job ever since , which is just over a year now .
because i ’ m very competent in this area .
you ’ re welcome .
anything that distracts you from work ?
if i were a manager , i would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . it is very important to have this one to one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction .
that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
i guess you're right . but like you said , you called me here to check me out . i've been doing the same .
sorry to hear that .
that's ok .
that's ok .
i'm very busy these days . it seems i can never finish my work .
i can't . i am really behind of my work .
he's dancing with jack !
his face broke out and he said it was my fault !
okay tracy , now it's too relaxed ! you've still got to show some respect . how about starting with dear ms . cooper , i'm writing to confirm . ?
inspiration can come in the strangest ways .
i know , and i apologize for the delay . but some things were just beyond my control . i had trouble booking the photographer , and then michael was sick for three weeks , so i couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so i had to re do the pictures .
sure , merton financial advisors .
ok . i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you . however , i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
did i ? well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up .
not bad . thank you for your help . i am always busy with this job , i feel a bit tired .
that's right , i have to work .
yeah . you can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
and what about that man there ?
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i ’ m really looking to settle down .
yes .
yes , of course . you will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints .
it will be expensive to do outside the campus . perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship .
ok . i understand that we basically work from 8 thirty to 5 thirty with an hour long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ?
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10 ?
mike , you're late again .
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
yes , my name is max richards . may i please speak to george nelson ? i have already called several times . it seems i always catch him out of the office .
we wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image .
no problem . good luck .
we will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance .
sure . i will ask lucy to call you in two days .
well , there are some similarities that come up . because both groups are made up of mothers . so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . but that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
let me check . it has a paper jam .
good afternoon . my name is monica . i am here for the job interview at 2 pm .
you mean the network connection ?
the environmental review board has a team on it now . hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week .
i have two people to a room . the $ 80 room rate is the lowest i could find . with the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing .
yes , i have decided to work with your company .
what kind of considerations are we talking about ?
well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
yes , i am james mason from anderson and associates . i would like to see mr . smith .
i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , i can ’ t send out this e mail . do you have the number of the text port ?
good idea .
yes , not bad . like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co workers .
i came two years ago after i graduated from college . this is my first job .
it is so encouraging to hear this remark . the secret is to make plans . write down your goals , short term and long term and make detail plans for a week or a month . then just work hard .
other company rules also need your attention .
hello , is doris available ?
what about the afternoon ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
what ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year .
mark wyatt ? i am sorry . the line is terrible . could you spell that for me , please ?
yes , i do . on a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?
i admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy going .
yeah i got a club card . here you go .
i know , i ’ m really sorry that i missed the deadline . but really , it wasn ’ t my fault . you see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that i couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that i needed for the data analysis . you know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the arm stable , then i wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline .
i am attending hebes university of technology .
i really enjoyed meeting with you .
great . thanks so much for your time .
yes . i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job .
no . thank you for the time .
can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ?
i learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them . in addition , i learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues .
that's a little less than i expected . but to me , the most important thing is the job and the people i will work with . moreover , i am sure i will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience .
let ’ s see . “ wanted
good . have you got any other questions ?
more than five years now . after i did my engineering degree , i began to specialize in computer technology and i even had my own company for a while .
i am 25 years old .
well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
but the competition is fierce this year . and it seems like i'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
i ’ m not in there very often . it ’ s so noisy that i can ’ t work .
that bad , huh ?
my background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . i want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged .
three times a year at most . how do you feel about this ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i'd like to postpone that discussion until later .
sure , but this week is crazy for me . can we make it next monday ?
this is mrs wang , from jane coper .
you have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time .
our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau fully designed . they ’ ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
not too worry , so tell me about yourself .
i know , but these are the figures that we came up with .
i am typing a report for the moment , mr . robbins . anything i need to do ?
yes , i know . a friend of mine is a guide . he talked with me about his work , but i don't mind working hard .
i see . he's usually here on tuesday mornings .
i know . he's usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side .
yes , it keeps me going . sometimes i think i'm addicted .
i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
john eng
that is fine . i think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so i will let you have the job . does the work schedule suit you ?
ok , thank you . goodbye .
i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . it ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because i move quickly and i am decisive .
it broke down one year ago .
hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . i think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . and if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . and basically , that's about it .
bye !
yes ! i agree ! we could really use another one ! i ’ ll get on that right away ! what else would you like to order ?
no problem . do you have any cash on you ? i don ’ t think i have enough .
i know , mr . douglas . but i am really sick .
sure . let me look over them and i ’ ll bring them back this afternoon .
sure , stacy . let me just grab my coat .
i ’ m sorry , clint . maybe i didn ’ t make myself clear enough . we should get together to discuss this .
i know . they ’ ve already sent back two approvals i sent them . where do i sign ?
hi , susan . what can i do for you ?
how so ? i thought it went fine .
i ’ m sorry . i thought we were all pretty much in agreement .
hi , jason . it ’ s elizabeth montgomery . have you got those plans drawn up yet ?
that was my line , mark . i know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line .
fine , madam . when will mr . brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
unfortunately , i'm leaving here unexpectedly , and i may be away for several days .
thank you for inviting me .
but i ’ ve never been on a business trip before !
oh no ! i forgot about those too ! those are chinese sausages for my aunt lily .
let me see . wednesday morning . yes , i am booked solid all morning . what ’ s up ?
that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ?
don't worry , we'll find someone eventually !
can ’ t complain . and you ?
nope .
there's an opening in the creative design department . it involves working with computers .
i ’ m well . and you ?
if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . if you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money .
i only started looking for a job a few days ago .
yes , i was precise with every word in my resume ?
could i first ask about the remuneration package ?
yes , i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in long term .
well , in a way yes . but i must say that even if i ’ m not completely happy in my work i always give 110 % i would never shirk my responsibilities . i suppose sometimes i expect too much too soon .
well i ’ ve always been keen on writing , so i became the editor for the university student magazine , which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter , to help the homeless in york .
yes , okay .
for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually , i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g
yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
don ’ t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear .
sure . i ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions .
first , i'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
that ’ s fine . i need to learn how you do things here first . salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ?
no , that ’ s all . i already have your resume .
yes , i do , susan . just a moment . here it is .
should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub committee there ?
it looks that way . that's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in .
i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
that happens often these days . well , please fill in this report of theft .
ok , we will send some men as soon as possible .
next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . do you know how to show time on a 24 hour clock ?
i will be available on monday or tuesday . choose which day is best for you .
yes , i can help you with that . pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons . do you hear a tone ?
what was the problem ?
things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit .
no , i don't think so .
my name is james .
i'll enjoy working with you . have a great day !
our first meeting is next monday . could you meet with us at that time ?
ok . i look forward to working with you . enjoy your week !
the binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too . understand ?
you get 2 weeks paid vacation and an additional 10 days of sick leave .
i ’ ll keep that in mind . thank you for coming in today . we ’ ll be in touch .
i am curious as to why you want to leave your current employer .
do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular .
the best opportunity is called callous , which is an internet based job placement service that you can make use of .
i am great . how are you ?
let ’ s go check it out again !
a notice of unemployment insurance award letter will be sent to you .
the employment development office will send you a notice of unemployment insurance award letter .
that is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment .
if it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in .
yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you .
fine , mr . tan . i ’ ll see you then .
all right , then . i ’ ll see you at noon on wednesday .
that ’ s fine with me . how much time are we going to have to work on this ?
let me take a look at the schedule . i ’ ll get back to you this afternoon , all right ?
what time ? i ’ d like to go , but my calendar is really full today .
he must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it .
he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving .
no , they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now .
i would like you to be my lawyer .
it ’ s a felony charge .
is this the information here ? well , let's take a look then .
i'd like to apply for a credit card with you .
perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! so , i can just upgrade automatically ?
the funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it .
you ’ ll be okay .
i voted for obama .
that ’ s lucky .
you ’ re a part of history .
what are you excited about ?
nobody could compete with him .
thank you , yes . i'm not sure how to use this atm , i usually go to a clerk and use my bank book . but today , i thought i'd try something new . i want to take some money out .
yes , i am expecting some money wired to my account from taiwan . would you please check if the money available yet ?
yes , i'm here . what details do you need from me ?
ok , as i expected . how much will you allow me to borrow ? i mean , i don't need a massive sum of money .
i'm going to have to do some more research into this . thanks for your help , bye for now .
you can always go to work late .
i sure did . how about you ?
did you vote for him , because i know that i did .
i can believe it , and i am very excited about it .
i sure am . how about you ?
i have no idea .
what are you getting donations for ?
i ’ m glad to hear that .
is that right ?
i can ’ t tell you that .

the inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . we do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods f . o . b . houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment .
i am not sure . what's the rate today ?
let me think . will the rate still go down tomorrow ?

that'll be fine . i appreciate your cooperation .
tampering with cartons is easily detected . i should say that this rather discourages pilferage .
your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at hong kong . how about shipping them from seattle instead of network ? you may choose either one as port of shipment . it makes no difference to us . there are more sailings from seattle than from new york .
it means that the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . the insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .
