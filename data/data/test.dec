i'd like to buy a skirt .
i think i'd better take that one you showed me just now . it is better than this one although this one is cheaper .
first of all , you should pay attention to what you eat . don't eat too much food with high calories , such as chocolate , ice cream and the like .

oh ! i see . can you show me the location of block i ?
you are welcome .
i'd like a coffee please .
i'm pretty social and outgoing , and i like making new friends . but i'm not a party animal , and i like to keep the apartment clean .
yes , you're at the right stop .
are you new here ?
three yuan .
that's very easy . the exit is always open .
better take the subway . it's far quicker and more convenient .
really ?
wait a moment , please .
on all our new cars , the standards include

what a pity . can you recommend a nice restaurant near here ?
what is the phone number ?
why did you drag me into this ? i've spent a week salary .
for a local call , just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone . inquiries are free from a public phone .
take it easy . we should be able to make it unless we get caught in a traffic jam .
yes , of course . there are many tea houses and bars in china , too . people can drink , eat and relax at these places .

sure , but i don't have hot water , yet .
to begin with , i have to use chopsticks .
anything strange about that ?
oh yeah . it loses only a few seconds in the whole month .
wait . i want to ask you if this bus goes down fifth avenue as far as greenwich village .
the whole wheat loaf is 45 cents , the white loaves are 35 cents each , the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each . that makes two dollars fifty seven cents .

not really . quite boring right now , actually . mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
and the host announced that he won it all !
yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal .
yes , much better . you can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home .
that's all right . have a good day .
really ?
you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world .
no , i thought that would be included in the rent .
no , it's all included . besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here .
it's bigger than our last one . i've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .
oh , i'm sorry .
thanks . could you tell me where i should deposit my bag ?
i think i might have a dahl .
it's just around the comer .
10 pence off if you use this coupon .

ok then , let ’ s get the chicken feet .
ok , and anything to drink ? maybe some jasmine tea ?
well it ’ s 100 rib for the sim card then it will cost you about 10 rib per minute to call the uk .
oh , don't mention it . it was terrible .
anyway , how was your such , catherine ?
i guess you're right . more often than not , people go there only for convenience . the foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
it's loaded ! for example , it's got a 256 color , lcd screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . also , it has a low light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient .
what does it do ?
i've been told that chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . we'd like to take some home . what would you recommend ?

i'll charge it . here's my card .
i'm glad to hear it .

but yesterday you said you would rent it .
then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . it ’ d be very good for us you know .
thank you . no . i ’ m late for dinner at my house . i really have to go .
i ’ d appreciate that .

of course .
well , my car won't start . i don't know what's the matter with it .
no , there is plenty of gas . i filled it up yesterday .

is it in the other pocket ?
fine .
and if you try to find a part time job , you'll have some money too .
how big is it ?
well , you know i have some students studying for their master's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
it's a well furnished eat in kitchen . the stove and the ice box are in good order , and the plumbing is ok , too .

yes . i ’ m tony . thank you very much .
yes ?
use the stairs , never the elevator .
grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods .

where are you heading now ?
very good . i feel quite refreshed now ! you should come with me sometime exercise is good for you !
the westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . the chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . i assume it is less complicated , right ?
this bus doesn't take you directly there . you ' d have to change buses twice . i suggest you walk . it'll take you less than 20 minutes .
what would you let me do now ?
it doesn ’ t make any difference to me .

what else i ’ ve got to do ? join the army ?
of course . it ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ?
no , i haven ’ t .

it's my pleasure , what can i do for you ?
oh , it's not very far . and as far as i know it is a fancy place .
yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why , how much did you pay for it ?
i don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in new york .
yes . i won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . is it a one bedroom apartment ?
yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . my family actually raises dogs for helping blind people .
i don ’ t mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything .
my english isn't very good . i didn't know what to say to them .

you don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . the most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .
perhaps you left that at school .

can you call back later ? we're right in the middle of lunch .
how much is it ?
you mean we'll share the taxi ?
i quite like this one . how much is it ?
of course . it's on memorial avenue .
what are you looking for ?
you're welcome .
well . actually . i was thinking about asking jess to marry me . i ’ ve just been so nervous .
last time i lent you money , you never paid me back .
what do you mean , mom ? for breaking your best china ?
it has never been worn . it was too small for me so i'm selling it .
get in slowly , sweetie . you'll get used to it . i'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup .
sure , for at least three thousand per month .
i'm glad . now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
hey , two for one . that's a super deal .
and i recently bought an american style washer and dryer . come and see .
sounds ideal . we'll get back to you in a couple of days then .
sure , i ' ll have a corona .
really ? it almost looks brand new . and the color designs are so retro .
i thought you had an unlimited sms plan ?
no wonder you didn't get my texts !
hi ! let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .
sure that sounds good . do you have any cakes ?
what about rubella and mumps ?
i've been there ! it really is an amazing work of architecture and art . the entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !
what ? why ?
i think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea .
well , his wife is japanese . he said she makes really good sushi .
from a sweet ma ? ! it's not worth it . plus , i'd happily pay more for these things i bought !
i can't , i have to go to the gym .
oh , i see . umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
that's so great !
my washing machine isn't working .
that ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! till next time !
excellent . how many would you like ?
that will be no problem , sir .
is that better ?
most of them in this store are from mexico .
may i take a look inside ?
great ! i want a three piece suit , preferably made from italian cashmere or wool .
yes . i ’ ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing , and pear has been falling behind in the market .
we can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he ’ s in a bit of a jam .
are you serious ? you always blow things out of proportion . in any case , i think i ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath .
i think i ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy .
well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
yeah right ! i ’ m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it ’ s really not healthy !
cardiopulmonary resuscitation !
me ! me !
yeah ! i am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor .
umm . yeah ! right ! i got the car started ! thanks for your help ! i told you to fill the tank !
oh john , i thought we said we would start eating right ! remember ? our new healthy lifestyle ? that ’ s all junk food !
they were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . and yes , john , we need organic carrots .
does that include some kind of love , amy card ?
there are such shops living on selling parts . i don ’ t like their service either . all they want is your money . but in the long run , they will be losing costumers . anyway , car service business is new in china . we all have to control what they are doing . otherwise , they will not improve .
not far away . it ' s over there .
sure . step in .
that's all right .
i want a pair of locus .
not really .
i'm sorry , sir . the price is fixed .
i'd prefer swordfish steak .
the salmon is good toady , it's very fresh .
i'd like to have it in big waves .
absolutely . mm , this is really good .
does all that come to 10 , 000 nt ?
you never know . maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy .
yeah . let's just lounge around !
and you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .
oh , how high class ! so you just wear it forever ?
ok .
maybe .
let's order something to eat . what are you in the mood for ?
then it wasn't meant to be . some people have put up a hard fight for some items i bid on . but i was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt cheap .
i'm sorry we don't ship overseas . it's too much trouble .
they're 250nt each , but they're not edible . they're only used for worship .
how has school been going ? you come home so late every night ! you're really a hard worker .
not at all .
what kind of anti virus software do you use ?
oh , paul is very easy going and friendly .
yes , what kind of apartment are you interested in ?

yep . that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames .
what are you talking about ? the alarm hasn't even gone off yet .
sure , i'll let you know if i need anything . hm , this mattress is very firm . jack will probably like it .
that's good . could you wrap it for me ?
then give me the ordinary ones .
light pink .
bill smith .
what happened to you ? you look like you got hit by a tornado !
um . uh . i'm just looking , thanks .
yes . do you have football stockings here ?
ok , i'll buy two pairs of each color . and do you have sports socks ?
ok . how about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer !
i'm looking for an mp 3 player . which brand is of the highest quality ?
you can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at fuxingmen transfer station . after you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards fuchengmen .
no , i ’ d rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today . what about that all you can eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
atlanta daily .
would you come here in twenty minutes ? we're right in the middle of dinner .

thank you .
okay .
what happened ?
good morning .
thank you . how much is it ?
yes . can i help you ?
as far as the language is concerned , it's worth reading .
that's great . but can't you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12 , 000 yuan ?
200 yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed .
no . it doesn ’ t . there ’ s no through bus to the national history museum madam
by the way , miss . where is the toilet ?
breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong .
looks like the one guy lost control in all this rain , and the other one hit him .
well , check the newspaper .
my boy wants me to buy a toy , so i think i ’ d better satisfy him .
oh , well , that might be a problem . i usually only sign one year leases .
the post office . sorry . i ’ m not sure .
hold on , paula . it does sound pretty serious . but i ’ m sure you can work this out .
i ’ d be glad to .
then , what ’ s the matter with you my child ?
ok , dear . we will be late .
just a moment please . yes . you can have a seat .

the special today is fried chicken , and beef is good too .
thanks . you have a good one , too .
hold on , please .
there is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?
your intention is good , but i still can't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .
you are welcome .
well , there is air conditioning . did you see that window air conditioner there ? the problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough .
really ? well . ok . get the receipts out .
come with me , please .
yes , i wanna buy a skirt .
ok , thank you .

oh hello , sally . this is dave thomson here . could i speak to jim please ?
ok . well , tell him i've called , will you , and i'll try again later .
yeah , i think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . but you are chinese , you should have known better .
oh , i see how this food can be really hard for you . i can sympathize with that . i stayed in sichuan for a year . the food was difficult at the beginning . every dish was so spicy . after a while , i got u
here are some nice brown hats . try this hat on . it ' s a very good one .
of course , that's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
why not try it on ?
can you recommend one ?
there's a little bread and there are a few biscuits .
all right , i'll walk to the village and i'll get some meat .

13924774026 . all right . thanks for calling . oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
yes , please .
well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , dvds , and a lot of nice clothing , too .
yes , i did . there ’ s an anti virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so i ’ m sure i haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone .
what about you ? you spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! not to mention how much you spend on clothes and .
well , this desktop over here is our latest model . it has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in ram and a hard disk with one terabyte . of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers .
so complicated ! ok , what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
do i have to pay an installation fee ?
there ’ s no catch ! you just choose a plan , sign a three year contract and , that ’ s it ! actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ regiving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan .
no , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
oh yeah ? tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ?
what type of tools ?
well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !
well , you have to make sure that your anti virus software is updated regularly . yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems .
yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer !
yes , even in the winter .
sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . you need to learn how to drive . you're lucky you didn't get killed . and i'm lucky to be alive too .
oh , yeah ? it's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital .
no , of course not . you have to put soap in . did you bring your soap ?
i ’ m in the middle of something right now . i ’ ll be there in a second .
you ’ re so picky sometimes .
got it . what else do you see ?
good . i am here visiting my girlfriend . i want her to have a good time .
yes , maybe it does . but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
yes , and i want to buy the insurance too . i think it's necessary .
ok . let's do it .
my sister already gave him one . i like something unusual .
that ’ ll be a big help . well , here ’ s a list of some of the food you could buy .
at what address , sir ?
that ’ s my wagon . i need the water to water my flowers in the yard .
thank you . where should i send your final phone bill ?
yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
he says he'll write a letter soon . he hopes we are all well . love , jimmy .
are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ?
thank you very much , sir . i ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you .
i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .
no . just bring yourself .
i ’ m fine , thank you .
that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment .
everything ’ s fine with me .
i don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .
the house has a very outdated electrical system . many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe .
you need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name .
yes . i ’ ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops .
i hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians .
that ’ s great . thanks very much . would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
after you ’ ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? just use a very small amount of oil . fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .
would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
i know you're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed .
i'd like that . alright , put on this apron first .
what is the rent each month ?
you got it .
thank you . yes , i would .
it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
not really . i went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all i needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its
there isn't much difference . but there is some difference . for one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive . they have very lightweight materials . they ' re designed for serious runner
don't worry about that . your english seems very good . and our instruction manuals are very clearly written . it's easy !
then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust .
dvd ? isn't that like a cd ?
she ’ s sitting under the tree .
yes , please .
but nobody uses macintosh !
do you have an appointment ?
we need to find a good realtor .
so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
i'm not really used to it yet .
like most foreigners , i really like sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken . i eat them almost every day .
i just bought these slacks a week ago . and i am a regular customer here . can you make an exception this time ?
i really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good !
i usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and i make dinner about 6 times a week .
i know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty .
i got it . don ’ t worry . i ’ ll get you there in one piece .
i am not sure what i want . do you have any house specials ?
that sounds good ! please bring me one of those .
you put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on .
there's nothing else to it .
you're welcome . let me know if you need anything else .
that'll be fine .
i'm a little short . i don't have enough for you .
i really don't have enough money .
i think you'll really like the food there .
there you go . problem solved .
i think i'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast .
i tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
apple pie is my favorite .
see , i helped you out .
my absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple .
i wouldn't mind a burger .
we'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience .
let's have four coffees , please .
thank you ! we have really enjoyed our meal here .
may i have the fettuccini alfredo ?
sure , that sounds great . where are your appetizers listed ?
what kind of salad do you want to make ?
that sounds like a great salad .
the fare is $ 1 . 25 .
when would you like the installation to be done ?
i can do that . is there a special way you want them washed ?
that's not my fault .
i'm telling you the truth .
why are you washing your clothes here now ?
why don't you wash clothes at home ?
i won't forget .
my plans aren't until later , so i'll clean it before i go .
we have movie channel packages .
we have that available .
i'm sorry . that's the only available time .
i need to speak with you about your daughter .
it is my pleasure to have her in my class .
i wanted to have a talk with you about your son .
your son was acting up in class .
i didn't mean to . it was an accident .
i really don't think that i did that .
what a wonderful neighborhood ! can you find that house on our open house list ?
how many hours of the behind the wheel course do i need to take ?
i'd like to make one now if i could .
yes , it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty five thousand to two hundred and twenty five thousand
thanks for all your help .
you need an appointment .
all right . now what ?
you didn't pass the test .
all right , i'm going to need you to fill this out .
can i see your id ?
thank you very much . please fill out this paperwork .
how far should i go ?
the 264 will take you there .
most normal little girls go wild over barbie dolls .
thank you . i will need a cashier ’ s check or cash , please .
you have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you .
do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust ?
you ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new .
where would you like me to pick you up ?
just sign here , please .
you're welcome .
i don't know . the produce person can tell you , though .
all of the produce is in aisle a .
you do realize that i will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ?
it ’ s my job . what can i help you with ?
when did the pipe start leaking ?
rather . i'm afraid i didn't do very well .
what would make this apartment better for you ?
do you have a map of the campus ?
would she like a laptop ?
a mac is a very popular brand .
including tax , your total will be $ 32 . 42 . cash or charge ?
well , a 15 inch pro is $ 2 , 100 .
does this one look big enough ?
a good choice . i prefer that one myself .
even if they break down , they're still works of art .
everything she needs is right here in the box .
dancing figures are quite popular . two of the boxes have them .
we have lots of fresh red roses .
they're only $ 20 a dozen .
women love roses , so your wife will be very happy .
you don't know ?
are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ?
i guess you have a point .
well , now i know the bus that'll take us back .
i see a problem .
it ’ s going to be a problem when my water bill comes .
i'm not completely sure if it really does .
sorry .
yeah , it'll take us there .
i would like to buy a new fridge .
great . your order will take only one week .
do you have any idea how many you'd like ?
you should just ask the bus driver for a transfer .
it's free ; just go ask for one .
let me see your student id .
you're welcome .
the 486 .
it starts getting more crowded the closer you get to la .
you need to get on the 261 . it goes all the way to sons .
walk all the way down fair oaks , and catch the 267 on altadena drive .
get off when you get to fair oaks and washington .
has this problem been going on for a long time ?
i'm going to go and get it right now .
so then , why don't you drive it ?
i've never taken this bus , but i think it's the right one .
i don't want cheese on it .
i ordered a ham sandwich , but they gave me a bologna sandwich instead .
what kind of ground beef do you need ?
do you know what to get ?
not yet . you should stand still for another few minutes . late comers must be recorded .
i'm a student . how about you ?
she must be very sad .
before i work in the office , i was a teacher . so if possible , i'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people .
there must be about 50 computers in here .
that's because regular buses don't stop here .
nothing . it's free .
hi simon . nice to meet you again
oh . history .
i know but i was busy with my part time job the last few days .
really ? that's great ! i know that your company has a lot of clients in france .
i must , if i want to pass the course .
now that you mention it , i'm getting a little bumed out from studying nonstop , too . listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine .
sure . can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ?
it's 0 7 7 8 7 3 6 7 6 8 8 .
mr . liu is available at 2:15 today . will that work for you ?
ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then . see you then .
it's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today .
i'm honored that you think i would be qualified . but i would really have to think about this first .
i've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . what about you ?
i don't know .
all you need is your student identification card to check out books .
i hear we'll have a new english teacher this semester .
i am sure i can get a 95 this time .
that's good , but i think it's too late . she hasn't studied all semester , and i doubt she can catch up in one week .
i once played truant when i was in college because i intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster hit areas in sichuan .
i don't want to talk about it .
suppose you want to find a book by your professor , william smith . you'd look under smith and then william . since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' william smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in .
really ? why ?
our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others .
stop it . teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else .
if you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it .
i think i'm going to decline . i just prefer to do my own thing .
it sure is . they also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . the center staff members are also friendly and helpful . everyone loves them .
well , what did you get in english 101 last year ?
he's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader .
sure . what do you want to know ?
i hope so .
you can't write with one hand and draw with the other .
thanks .
yes . may i help you ?
why are you so pessimistic ?
don't worry about it . practice makes perfect . i will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . i believe you can pass the exam with good preparation .
the job market is so competitive nowadays . i want to develop some useful skills .
sorry , it's tails . you lose .
i mean , we could flip a coin for it , but i would probably win again . i'm incredibly lucky you know . especially with girls .
well , i hope so . the competition is probably pretty heavy . and they want a writing sample too .
you just said your english needs work , yes ?
let's see . my schedule right now is quite busy . but i think i could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .
and i will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . i would like to record some things so i can practice on my own .
yeah , i quit .
what ?
that ’ s no laughing matter . that means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . i can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning .
well , i sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , i don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . you were trapped in the system . if you want , you can talk to the director . she will help you if she can .
it's me , sir . but i am sorry i have forgotten to prepare for it .
so i take it you are not interested .
there's many books here . what about these ?
if you don't know it by now , you might as well not bother studying .
of course . there you are .
yes , i've been thinking about visiting you . i hope to get some advice from you .
my field is electronic engineering . which country do you think i should go ?
yes . i'm just waiting until i officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa .
i ’ m looking forward to reading that . we could have book signings by famous professors an alumni .
do you want to go to and empty classroom ?
as a matter of fact , i do . after she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . then , she started writing children ’ s book .
of course ! both children and adults enjoy her books .
yes , i intend to go to university . that'll be in september . but it all depends on my a level results .
the system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the united states .
well , i am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but i haven't decided on the other subjects yet . i'd like to take english .
whatever am i going to tell me parents .
yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but i haven't been able to find it .
forget about school and exams . come over to my house and have fun . i have some really good dvds .
hi , this is maria . is that shirley ?
i've got a letter from my bank here . it shows i am able to support myself during these three years of studies .
he's an old antique , very serious .
it's very helpful . the course has let me into a new world of literature . i read so many great literatures .
professor donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
i am going to be a , well , i hope to be a research chemist .
hey ! how about your history teacher ?
i thought you would like pe .
you mean the white building near the playground ?
of course . here you are .
all you need is your student identification card to check out books .
yes . she teaches our class three times a week .
thank you . that ’ s perfect timing .
then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . have you seen those signs ?
we are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next monday . do you have something to write that down on ?
one class is on tuesday and thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 .
well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do .
i don ’ t know . what do you think ?
did you bow back ?
i completely understand . i didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt .
no problem .
you're right .
well , that's not far away .
i know the perfect place !
there will probably be a book list in the bookstore . do you have your class schedule handy ?
to get started , take that list over to the bookstore . do you know where the bookstore is ?
perfect ! do you know the hours and rules for the library ?
i am really not sure .
that ’ s everything .
i want to check this magazine out .
i would also like to check out this video .
what is the problem ?
when you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the admissions and records office or you will not be added . can you find the office ?
what can i help you with ?
do you attend school during the day or only at night ?
well , i can see that's a problem .
well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day .
well , if i total that like this and divide by this number , i get this total . do you agree ?
step into my office for a moment . what is your concern ?
you ’ re welcome . have a nice day .
thanks . i really appreciate that .
that ’ s perfect .
exactly how much do i owe ?
i won ’ t be able to pay that right now .
does it cost to use it ?
okay . thanks for your help .
i get lost in this library .
i ’ m great . thanks .
what are your hours on saturday ?
i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work .
about two weeks ago .
thanks . i'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course .
fine , thanks . how are you ?
the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree !
i turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . but i ’ m a senior now , i don ’ t want to miss the chance this time .
while seeing others going to work or continue their study , i didn't know what i would do .
perhaps i ’ m being too shy . i should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests !
i buy a computer magazine every month . it keeps me up to date with all the latest developments .
i find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall .
it ’ s an article about language . it talks about the idea of having a single global language .
math , sheath . what ’ s the evidence ?
well , ok . but no french kissing !
thanks . i ’ m proud of myself , too .
i ’ m serious .
let me see it .
don't mention it . you ' re always been good . what do you say we go out to celebrate ?
i'm sorry to have made you disappointed .
he is really terrific !
what is it ?
oh .
about what ?
of course you can call the police if you want . that's not what i mean . i'm just saying that they probably won't do anything .
thank you . i wasn't sure if it looked okay or not .
thanks ! i'm so happy . it's like a dream come true .
oh , never mind about that .
great ! this calls for a celebration .
well , uh . i didn't catch the last part .
thank you . i was lucky this time .
sorry . was i disturbing you ?
that's an understatement . i'm on cloud nine . i couldn't be any happier .
i saw the sixth sense . i didn't know it was going to be so scary .
get out of here !
don't bother .
ok . i will talk to him direcly .
thank you .
oh , it's nothing to speak of .
i am very sorry to hear that you ’ ve been having so many problems .
i'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble .
wow ! congratulation ! when do classes start ?
very good . i'd like to do that .
how about tomorrow night ?
ready for what ?
yes . you've done a good job . but there's one thing . you should narrow down your topic .
i'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long .
look , just give me a chance . i can explain it .
come on . give it a chance . the movie just started .
sounds good . the food there is fantastic too .
poor femi . taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him .
my older sister judy will be here soon to help . she already has a boy and a girl of her own .
i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . that ’ s a real let down .
i ’ m afraid i have some business to attend to .
no , thanks . his home is not far and i can walk there .
i'm going to refund your money right now .
yeah . i am on edge since she was out to the match .
i like them very much . they are delicious .
daniel , hold on for a minute . what are you trying to pull there ?
you are not the gray train , i guess . but bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again .
no , why should i ? i don ’ t feel like it . besides , i ’ m in such a bad mood .
but you did a good job . you always perform the best in our company .
how about a training course ?
whatever am i going to tell me parents .
stay away from me .
i'm ok . i'll be fine . i'v cool . i'm cold . i'm like ice . she won't know what hit her .
i ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . i ’ ll turn to it right away .
it's leap my mind . i really feel terrible about it .
i ’ m not in the mood .
oh . i just can ’ t forget it .
i'm glad you like it . the bell is on the bedside . just ring if you want anything . the room attendant speaks a little english . so i don't think you'll have any trouble .
yes . when i came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up .
you said she used to ? how did you stop her ?
hi , gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why didn ’ t you meet me there ?
you see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
well , it can't be helped . we'll just have to put up with it .
yeah , me too .
of course .
oh , good ! we can all get together again .
oh , yes . we all sat on the grass , and margaret played the guitar and sang greek songs .
you ’ re right . everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . i ’ ll keep you informed .
you do ? ok , fine with me .
that wouldn ’ t be a lie !
didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ?
are you nuts ? what would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ?
that ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special .
oh , i don't care about that .
oh , i'm sorry to hear that , sir . what exactly is problem ?
well , i am telling you now .
well , i want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! you ’ re a hard worker !
every day i have less money ! i haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate .
when did you learn to dance ?
will you forgive me . could you return my camera ?
today is so hot , besides i had so much housework to do . my friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . i didn ’ t forget , but i had no time at all .
they are cucumbers . they are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin . haven ' t you heard them say on tv that . eh . they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ?
well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , i hate that idea .
it is still a mystery to me .
it's my new pendant . do you like it ?
sure . that ’ s really nice of you . let ’ s go in and try some things on .
but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy .
but you don't have such a problem as to pop songs .
what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ?
i'm crazy about it . it makes me very excited .
but i definitely was led to believe that a three night stay would be $ 750 .
well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me !
have you ever talked to them about it ?
let ’ s go for a joy ride .
come on . it ’ s quite safe . you really have no guts .
why didn't you tell me about that before ?
why is that ?
it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
let's take the bus .
well , my saddle is too low for me . do you know how to change the height ?
you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america .
what is the date today ?
i can hardly make ends meet these days .
sounds a good idea .
hmm . have you got a receipt ?
what is it ? why did you buy a brick ?
but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
what is it ? what happened ?
almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
run ! they are thirsty for more !
too bad .
that's about five blocks . and around corners too . so he was definitely following you .
what ? what did you buy ?
but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
i ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . see , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty sixth of march .
license and registration please . have you been drinking tonight , sir ?
yes , i've been sitting here for a few minutes . i'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car .
are you serious ?
oh , well , i looked around . there wasn't any other space . i waited a while and nobody came . i'm sorry if i've taken your place .
what's wrong ?
it was a kind of sixth sense .
off hand , i'd say the reader's digests is my favorite .
no , it's a semimonthly .
fine , thanks . how about you ?
yes , i hope we meet again .
yes , i've been thinking about florida .
calm down !
i've seen her on tv but not in the flesh .
yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . i often go to his house to play and talk with him . that makes him feel very happy .
take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch .
what have you been doing ?
it's been nice talking to you .
okay .
so we can get down to business .
yes , beautiful weather we're having .
yes , i'm used to being on my own .
he makes me sick .
i'll put the survey online this afternoon .
could you drop it off on sunday night ?
i'm almost done .
have you thought about the cost ?
don't feel like it . i'm broke .
it was . let's stick with the regular choices today , though .
yeah . it's so nice of you to comfort me .
i think i'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you .
i saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .
are you sure you want me to cut it that short ?
do you really want it that short ?
what ? you don ’ t love me ? me , either .
what's the big deal ?
sure , a promise is a promise .
what's the matter ?
what are we waiting for ? it's already 7 pm now . let's buy some drinks and desserts now .
you've got no guts !
that's great ! what time will it start at ?
light music and classic music .
i suppose this song can be the no . 1 on the top chart .
my pleasure . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer .
certainly ! i suppose you dance often .
i'd rather you didn't .
you got what i meant . perhaps , what i steal are not vegetables , but loneliness .
oh , dear , i'm so happy .
yes and no .
what about the yellowstone national park ?
sure .
once in a while .
i had a fantastic time .
same to you .
i like it . it's a beautiful country .
i'm from canada .
that's true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
hey , young man , you are so deep today .
then , you should dress well .
i hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . have you bought the tickets ?
this sweater is so pretty . i love the low neck design .
first we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . then we will visit the university museum .
sure , but i have to tell you that i've become a vegetarian . i don't eat any kind of meat .
and i like the festivities of winter with thanksgiving , christmas and new year .
me either . from the very first page , this author just pulled me right in !
it is kind of strange though , to have snow in april , and so much of it .
and where are you from , jack ?
he said there are only all kinds of good weather .
actually , we bought the ring together after i got the watch .
hell no ! you're just a chicken that's all .
yeah . i heard a lot about it . is it really that fun ?
what did you have in mind ?
it's good to have you in the group . we can always use a good baritone !
that will be fine . what i have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time .
you don't have to .
now we know that they realize the real meaning of christmas .
right .
well , it's snowing . let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing .
yeah . thanks for the talk .
i don't think so . i've been following her around campus and i haven't seen another guy .
sure .
it's very thoughtful of you . wow , it is so beautiful . could you tell me how american people celebrate christmas ?
all under the precept of keeping the funding ? that stinks .
it was a foreign film called ' gone with the wind ' .
i disagree with you . companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company
yes , nobody was with her .
are there any good seats left ?
here is the money .
what time does it begin ?
ok . let's go .
i have many hobbies . i like almost all kinds of sports and i also like to listen to classical music .
throw the ball up high .
don't you think it ’ s too noisy here ? the rock music ! i can hardly bear it .
well , i'll try . then what would you like to drink ? it's on me .
thank you . oh , it tastes excellent .
come on , ted , don't be such a chicken . if you like her , you've got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
are you serious ?
no , but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home !
i wanted to , but i knew that if i spoke to her , i'd just blow up at her , so i decided to just go home . i called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone .
i just broke up with a girl . why didn't she understand that i loved her ?
it ’ s ok . it seems we have a lot in common .
i'm from madras .
oh , david . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what should i do if he doesn't call me ?
i like taking photos .
yeah . let's plan something tomorrow .
i concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach .
great . i'll call you saturday morning .
mr . smith has changed his job .
certainly .
absolutely .
me too .
sure . that'll be 40 yuan , please .
i usually read or entertain myself .
that's true . i should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time .
what is a sixties party ?
tomb sweeping day is a traditional festival in china , on which many chinese mourn the dead .
yes . it is also called dragon boat festival .
we'll have rice dumplings . what's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern china .
don ’ t you know christmas is coming ? i have a lot of things to get ready .
mainly seascapes .
sure . here you go .
yes . how are you , anna ?
you are kidding .
let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute .
i'll think about it after i start feeling better . right now , i don't even want to hear the word snowboarding .
oh , really . i thought he lived with his wife .
yeah , cal ripen just hit a home run .
yes .
just looking at some books on how to learn english .
i've no idea . i'd like to listen to your suggestion .
of course ! or are you still too scared !
to be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous .
great idea ! peter , i could use the drink .
sounds good . the food there is fantastic , too .
yeah , i started to learn english when i was in high school .
i'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door .
oh , fresh juice , i love it . well , i heard american people love hanging out in bars . is that true ?
they suddenly become shy when they speak to boys .
she is certainly not my kind of girl .
how about at the subway entrance .
some are entertaining , but i find most of them stupid and childish . for example , i don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious .
i always do volunteer work on the first saturday of every month .
i listen to a lot of hip hop . what about you ?
yes ! the first time i saw her i knew we would fall in love .
i'm just watching some television .
that's right . what do you think we should do as a hobby ?
so ?
right . luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him .
i enjoy oil painting . i learned it in one of my extra classes in college .
hum , edward norton , or something like that .
wow , that's really old .
thanks . i'll let him know .
ok . wait a minute .
say what you want to say .
spring will come soon . and we will have some pleasant weather then .
classic . something that could calm your mind .
i didn't realize it was so difficult though i know i'm always too nervous in such competition .
i know . if you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it .
yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ?
we are on the high way . find the pound shade
i graduated from songhua university .
right ! anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital .
like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves .
of course . that's why i bought this type . i can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it .
any other common customs of your new year ?
good afternoon , mr . green .
oh , you are so nice . what a lovely scarf .
just plug in a peripheral cd or floppy drive and you're ready to go !
what's net love ?
impossible !
i want to tell you that i like you
i'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .
i know . i wonder what's keeping him .
i don't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
i had to go by myself , he couldn't make it .
his excuse was familiar . he said his car died again .
what docking station ?
at least you haven't landed in the water yet . i've done that on the last two holes .
thank you ! the same to you .
we're going to visit my sister in the city .
i'm fine . thank you .
i can take a break at lunch time , but it is only 30 minutes .
what is it ?
do they live with you and your parents ?
oh my gosh , how exciting !
oh , don't . i'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever !
maybe , but i think they are just for kids .
yes . he is very understanding and supportive .
oh , i see . people who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . i can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . in this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower garden's being neglected .
sure . but it is too cold today . i have to put on warm clothes and look stupid .
well , thanksgiving is family event . so on thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big thanksgiving dinner . kids will have lot of fun .
that surely will cost you a lot of money . are you going to make a full payment ?
no , thanks . i have had enough .
it depends . in some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . many kids cannot afford to go to school .
not at all . i think the tattoos are so cool and chic .
he isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ?
i don't find this surprising . the poll data sound quite right . he is a good president .
good . i love chinese food . what did you order ?
i hope so . did you know the us successfully sent two robotic explorers to mars last month ?
but it's true . it's a nasty habit . i can't think why i ever started . anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
we are fishing with worms . the fish seem to like them .
do you think they'll become reconciled ?
why not ?
i'm a firm united supporter . i like their playing style . the reds always have several excellent wing backs , like riggs , peckham and gary neville . they often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking .
she is miao li . she's come here to see her brother .
the supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole .
er . what else can i tell you ? er . she's got . er a . round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth .
why do you listen to rap ?
yes , l have two of her cds , l'ii lend them to you if you like .
sounds good . what should we see ?
you mean the one starring john travolta ?
disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . but i don't do the rock and roll and the break dance .
oh , yes , it is .
small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms .
i might be able to do that . but i don't think i can do it well .
i want some computer games also . i gave my parents a really long christmas list .
i hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
merry christmas to you !
oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he's running around with the wrong crowd .
well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like beijing . i think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . bicycling home after work can help release your stress . life in the offices is miserable . you just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? enjoy the speed on the road . just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . how great !
do you have clubs ?
hey !
well , the stereotype in the movies is that l . a . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . i guess , in the back of my mind , that's what i expected .
yes , it's so exciting , though i had the most falls in our skiing team .
it really doesn't matter at all . i never did like it anyway .
that ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on .
he's going to turn six next month .
ten days ago .
it costs more than you think to run a car especially when there are so many things wrong with it !
and i must thank you again for your generous help .
of course not . i knew she had fallen in love with another guy . it is difficult to see her move on so quickly .
yes . they were open this morning when i came to work . they must've finished remodeling . why do you want to know ?
sorry , i can't dance .
sort of yes .
i didn't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight . from then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
hi .
you speak english very well .
that's fine . i'm looking forward to it .
where do you want to go ?
i'd love to .
oh , where is that ?
he has the flu .
thanks . i'll tell him .
mrs . smith , what do you do for work ?
oh , i don't like that restaurant . i don't want to go there .
it's fine today .
it rained all day yesterday . the weather was awful last week .
yeah . i bet you did forget everything . what's the date today , do you know ?
thank you .
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
i see . will you bring a lot of money with you ?
i'm terribly sorry i can't go with you . shall we find some other time ?
yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country .
the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don't believe that any single country can do anything about it .
yeah , time is money . we really need to make good use of it .
yes , you're right .
yes , maybe i should have another try .
don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8: 00 .
ok . i have a good pair of hiking boots . it should not be a big problem .
all i'm trying to say is that life is . like . er . this painting .
yes , i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
where did you go ?
that would be great .
i've been having a hard time sleeping lately .
thank you . i'll certainly be there .
maybe . after all , i am grown up now .
i'ii have another cup of beer insist . i know i don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
i was in new york for a wedding .
oh , yes please ! i'd love a gin and tonic .
i've been really busy . how is everything ?
how do you pay for it ?
ok , mum . i'll invite my friends home .
hi , lin tao . i have't seen you for some time .
you're right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore .
maybe you should ask him openly .
yes , it's really a surprise . how are you ?
that sounds great . i'm absolutely starving ! what kind of food are you in the mood for ?
my mother works in a company as an accountant .
what's up ?
yes , we should go . thank you very much . goodbye !
sure . have you got anywhere in mind ?
if you want spicy food , then i'd recommend going to a thai , indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ?
you're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us .
i had to visit all my relatives .
ok . i'll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i'm going to the meeting .
just cats , but i don't think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
i don't really . i just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
it is the colorado river . you can go down the river in a boat if you wish .
there is a beautiful state park here . i can see why so many people come out here to camp .
i know . i still haven ’ t heard from her . the good thing is that i ’ m so angry with her that i don ’ t feel sad about not having her around .
i have to run to the grocery store .
oh , thank you . your skirt looks beautiful , too .
i ’ ve been to qingdao before , so i ’ ll choose dalian . i've heard that the environment there is very good .
let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . how much money do you have in your savings ?
good morning , gav ! did you sleep well last night ?
yes .
no , he left nothing .
i'd like to very much .
i can tell it from your build .
oh , it has nothing to do with me .
oh , i've no interest in such films .
it was also a proud day for me , but i also felt like a kind of loss that day .
yes , but i don't like the story .
but it went by fast . it was interesting .
me too .
but what can you do ?
she knows how to speak spanish and japanese .
no , i don't like it very much . do you ?
because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life .
in 1978 . i went to college here .
now that's an exciting job ! ! !
is malibu beach nice ?
it seems that you don't like him .
it definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .
yes .
right . so in some way we are happier .
great ! i can't wait .
i see . ok .
not very well . he was white about the gills .
yeah , it happened a week ago .
that sounds wonderful . will there be anyone there that i know ?
good afternoon ! sit down , please . how are you ?
in london . where do you live ?
cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
27th day of the fourth month .
yeah .
really ? i'm so glad to hear that . but i don't know how to get access to the internet . could you show me ?
i'm afraid not .
i know , but i was so upset . i mean , come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ?
let's enter it !
r i n ?
after all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . she must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back .
what do you mean ?
art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say .
no idea . we've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . what else is there to see ?
i don't know . i am not really worried about that . i don't wanna lose before even starting . besides i think the other two american guys have also fallen for her .
there's nothing definite i think . i don't have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends .
maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too .
no . but my husband smokes 20 or more a day .
what do you mean ?
well , it's hard to say . i cough a lot in the evening .
how have you been ?
i ’ m worrying about the children . after all this is the first time they have been out without us .
it's very dangerous , you know .
actually , i ’ ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on nanjing lu . they were delicious !
well , brad from school asked me out just today .
thank you so much , lisa !
that sounds good but i don ’ t know what ’ s on .
sure , i ’ ll catch the train . if i can ’ t catch the train , i ’ ll get a taxi .
he ’ s fine . he retired last week . it ’ s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
how do you do ? mr . brown . i am susan heywood .
shall we go out tomorrow then ?
sounds fun . anyone i know ?
i totally disagree . the other day i read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver .
that's right
yes , i enjoyed it very much .
i like classical music . do you ?
maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people .
i am always on the look out for such girls .
yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc .
but i still love you .
yeah . you said it .
yeah . i have got much pressure in the company . i have tobe wrapped upon my work .
yeah , well , i fill you in one the details later .
oh , steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he doesn't call ?
i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
yes , i came to beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . i was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company .
i didn't lie . you just didn't ask me my real name .
i know . i can't tell whether he's serious or not so i need your advice .
bo , of course not . he is still single .
worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed .
yeah , some places are very short of water .
it ’ s saturday , a great weekend .
me too .
what a shame !
i'm really sorry i let you down . i'll make it up to you somehow .
she'd better keep away from them .
well , i believe it now , and when are they are getting married ?
i was the only one who got a strait a in my class .
i really appreciated it .
it suits us fine . we ’ ll see you then .
everything's great . and you ?
you know that i care for you . i i ’ m proud of you .
i guess you're right . but i still prefer to have no child .
i've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business .
thank you . i wish i would .
i'm sure of what i'm doing .
he has been keeping bach after divorce .
oh , tom ! they sound fantastic . i really like all those things .
i'm pretty sure i'll be all right . in fact , i'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . what time are you planning to start ?
what do you do there ?
did it hit their house ?
what were they doing when you called ?
sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . you need to learn how to drive . you're lucky you didn't get killed . and i'm lucky to be alive too .
i'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . i've asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . i hope you'll like them .
i'd like both .
thank you very much .
yes . oh , it's you , linda . i haven't seen you for a long time . well , come in and sit down . how about something to drink ?
sure . she is a peaceful child .
that ’ s too bad .
america ? did you get admit to mit ?
kyoto is lovely . it's full of beautiful old temples and gardens . it ' s a very historic city .
you're welcome . good luck , bye !
excuse me ?
i'm sorry i'm late . i overslept . is the manager here today ?
you are probably right . i'll go right now and apologize . i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic .
not bad . thank you for your help . i am always busy with this job , i feel a bit tired .
nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ?
what is the matter ?
i calmed up . and finally , i asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . i could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal .
maybe all of us are the same .
oh , i think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father .
then he is really lucky .
yeah . i think everyone should go easy on driving .
that ’ s really unbearable .
if you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . you can ’ t have it both ways , of course .
no problem . you know him . he ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles .
where are you going ?
yes ? anything i can do for you ?
really ? in my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat .
yes , we are .
yes , i packed it myself .
i bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .
yes , i do . i think that science is making us wiser . what do you think ?
thanks . lovely day . pity i ’ m on duty .
yes . don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ?
they ’ re nice .
no . i'm afraid i haven't had time since i got married .
pretty good , thanks . and you ?
three days .
well , trains are frequent and come on time .
aha . i've read of my roommate . i made a move today .
my invitation ? no , i haven't . my invitation to what ?
use the stairs , never the elevator .
it's super .
what about saturday ?
i ’ m glad that you like it . this is only the first time that i made it .
thanks for inviting me , jack , but i ’ ve already made plans for this weekend . i won ’ t be able to come , i ’ m afraid .
absolutely right . he gave a performance of felix mendelssohn's violin concerto . that caused a sensation . the audience were stunned by his pure tone .
no , ah . single sellers .
hello , my old friend . long time no see . how are you doing ?
the winter is very rainy , i don't like the rainy day .
mm . it's quite warm now .
well , let's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it's a little expensive , but it's fun .
if i were you , i would change the beginning . you should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .
that's right .
yes , my first marriage was a failure .
yes , i ’ m afraid i am . my husband is a smoker too .
what time are you leaving ?
take care and give my best to your parents .
you're kidding !
that's something else ! maybe i'll return it to them .
you'll recover after a good night's sleep .
thank you . it was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know .
and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself .
yes , of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines .
it doesn ’ t matter to me .
yes . i ’ ve won the first prize in the math contest .
you mean they're kicking you out ?
nine total . seven children and my parents .
oh , i see . you know , we spend time doing different sports . how much time do you spend exercising ?
oh . that's ok . as long as you're buying !
it ’ s a wonderful spanish style .
that's better .
i think so too . it's just pointless .
yeah , what't the bet ?
yes . he ’ s already got the passport and visa .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
i will be all right soon . i was terrified when i watched them fall from the wire .
thank you for your concern .
yes , certainly . how can i recognize him ?
when is the last time you talked to you parents ?
have you thought about going in dutch ?
well , it's not as good as my french . i can speak it reasonably well , but my written spanish isn't very good .
you better do some exercise every morning .
you know , i often have to work til late at night . i need something to keep me awake .
thank you for your advice ! i'll try it .
he's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . i want no distractions .
yeah , she is some kind of superwoman , isn't she ?
and i travelled a little bit in australia . i went up the east coast . up to frasier island . which is a world heritage site . and i saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . we climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the . , which is a but north . and the further north you go in australia , the hotter it gets . so we were able to go swimming in the ocean and i went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause i didn't have a diving license , so i went on an introductory dive and i saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that i was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly .
live chicken ? thanks , but no thanks . so . tell me about bargaining . how can i do it like a local ?
way to go , mary . a lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ?
maybe this is god's will .
maybe one month . just have a try first . not too tough at the beginning .
yes , i ’ m afraid i am . my husband is a smoker too .
actually it is . perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign .
there , on the window .
oh , i ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there .
in the spring .
plenty . we never worry about lack of rainwater in our area .
it's very hot , the temperature is often over 40c .
i lived there for three years . i like summer but i don't like winter .
well , let's go and have something to drink instead . i know a good place . it's a little expensive , but it's fun .
of course . you see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby
it was terrific . the concert was really a hit . the symphony orchestra was so good that i was completely absorbed in their performance .
the weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week .
the weatherman predicts a fine day today .
my parents .
today ?
i hope i can fly to any place like superman . so i can touch the sky .
boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . i like it but i couldn't do it that well .
dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ?
why doesn't he ask her ?
he is everybody's type .
i'm sorry . every customer coming here must do the warm up exercise before getting down to swimming . that's out regulation .
let me see . teetee training school , summer program , 3 , 000 yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months .
don't worry . let's check out some other schools .
are you stupid ? they are called ufos , so not everybody can see them .
last night he told the children a cliff hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep .
nothing , thanks . i am just not in the mood these days .
yes . i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted .
i'm a gs 15 . that's high on the scale of workers , but even a gs 1 is paid a living wage .
that is a deadly risky business . he should have it coming on him .
i ’ ve done that . the doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking .
yes , to tell you the truth . i am on the diet .
how do you do ? i'm ted nugent .
glad to meet you .
yes , sunday sounds fine . what time ?
it must be about 6 o'clock .
you needn ’ t buy one . you can have mine .
i doubt it , i'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , i ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth .
no , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . look at the himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world .
my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country .
pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country .
that ’ s very specialized . so , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct , the other would too .
i see . the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions .
sure . take a seat . what would you like to know ?
it was 10 hours .
no , not at all . i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
i don ’ t really have one but i support huston .
i have the same problem . the players are really very skilful . i wish i could play that well .
yes , i do . we ’ re doing pretty well this season . we ’ ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table .
yes , i'd love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i was , but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so i ’ m not a member now .
i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films .
how do i do that ?
i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i ’ d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force .
the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there ’ s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful .
i think i ’ m polite , careful , relaxed and shy .
i think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in .
1 thirty p . m . but i've got to check in at 12 thirty p . m .
i have , actually . how about the movie , million dollar baby with clint eastwood ?
you are a sensible drinker . anyway , i ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . i don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover .
in that case , i'm fit for the position i think .
but everything has been so easy .
i suppose i do .
you should take their advice . they know what's best for you .
and if you try to find a part time job , you'll have some money too .
the bank closes in 30 minutes and i need to cash a check .
that ’ s not a bad idea . bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee .
there are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up to date with expensive clothes .
it must be locked .
forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk .
be careful of yourself .
i'm a student at ucla .
it's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
yes ?
morning sally ! what's up ? you seem many hurry !
well , you ’ re in luck ! you see , if you sign up for our three year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free .
excuse me . i wonder see dean mr . lee first . i was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ?
saint jude he's the saint of lost causes . like my cousin , anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . she's a lost cause .
what kind of girl is she ?
this girl i've been chatting with for the past couple of months . she's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
i'm ready ! whoa , what a hard throw ! i can't get that !
no . what did it say ?
well , have you thought of getting an mba ? i heard it does wonders in getting you to the top .
up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . going to church might help as well !
i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic .
yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .
are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good !
fine , but i ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me .
it ’ s about time !
yeah , i'm ok , i have been having a lot of mood swings lately . i think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones .
what do you mean ?
well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives .
well , i heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so i thought i'd be nice and make santa cookies . i even left out some milk . i heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so i came downstairs !
all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
oh , hi melissa . are you going to the conference too ? i was planning to pick up mr . campbell .
where are you going ?
you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn ’ t even have met if i hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago !
men are like that you know . they can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness .
laura .
i wanted to , but i ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! i was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place .
from china .
yeah ? how ’ s he doing ?
i ’ ve heard this one before .
yeah , about 5 minutes ago .
this ref needs glasses . hey ref , open your eyes ! i can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that !
i don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there ’ s just too much instability . i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . you already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music .
sounds great , i'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
ok , i will see you then .
hi jack , i'm working on these documents . the manager wants them for half an hour .
i like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . you know , i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it's too loud though . you prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?
hello ! i was exhausted some studying , so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately , the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet .
look after yourself . bye .
anytime . you can reach me 5558929 .
if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters .
i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late .
the weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . our weather is so changeable .
i usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . i try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two hour drive on the motorway .
i ’ m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that ’ s very fast for a kid his age .
be seeing you then !
what should we take ?
on that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts .
ok with me . you are the boss . i will meet you downstairs after work .
great , here are some flowers for you . i hope you like them . i was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment .
yes , thank you .
thanks .
sorry . we ' ve nothing further back .
yeah , it'll make a hit , i think . when will it be on , do you know ?
what's it about ?
but i think it wasn't too bad .
how do you get through the stuffy daytime ?
what ’ s wrong with climate ? anyway , i think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . can ’ t people do something to stop it ?
oh , it's too far to walk there . we can take a bus .
you're mistaken about it . as a matter of fact , it's very hard .
toss a coin to decide then .
are you ? what are you busy with ?
and then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your show is on . you are going to break your promise .
good question . i have to think about it .
this is just what i have in mind . where are you planning to go ?
actually , i could you some help . thank you so much .
nice to meet you , andrew . i am noirin , noirin o'neil .
i would say it's about 5 degree celsius .
i go to bed at ten and get up at six .
i guess so . better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .
how about great canyon ?
well , california ’ s changed over the last little while . you should come back out sometime .
sure . but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . the only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog .
he's late again . traffic is probably holding him up . you know , he commutes from the suburbs . it's not easy commuting every day . we should cut him some slack .
not bad , just let it go .
yes , but i don ’ t think it was enough . he looked disappointed . i gave him three dollars .
that sounds just right to me . what was wrong with it ?
it ’ s okay . i don ’ t want to go now . we ’ ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . i don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
sometimes , usually once every few weeks . do you ?
i didn ’ t , but i applied for an apprenticeship , and since i studied math , and i have a good attitude , my application was accepted .
oh , i ’ m too lazy to play sports , and i ’ m not good at anything either . it hardly excites me .
believe what ?
yeah . well it's quite some days since we were together last summer . how is everything going ?
why ?
i can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . and all for a certain look .
i think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy .
why ? i'd like to see what's on that channel .
ok .
i wish i had been there !
it's hard to say , i like interesting and significant ones . i don't care whether they're blockbusters or not .
he's a hero in our town .
yes , my sister loves his personality .
alps , suppose .
can you give me a touch of his character ?
i'm sorry for hero . i dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss .
gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . let's go out and get crazy tonight .
i think our success is partly because of wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field .
let's hope it is !
impossible ! well , i'm not giving up yet . it's not over till the fat lady sings !
only about old movies , really .
i will do .
why ? are you planning to stir fry my face ?
let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . it ’ ll help me loosen up .
you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but last time i saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . i saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . is it open now ?
how did you know that ?
he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics , right ?
i can think of better things to dream about .
i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ?
fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
sorry , i have to work overtime .
sounds not bad ! you know , the only thing i worried about is the safety . i ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport .
that ’ s not right , somebody should do something .
i'm pretty satisfied with it . i can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities .
well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not too high shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company ’ s dress code .
i love it . it's so festive ! and where did you get that cup ? it's got the same logo .
see you !
yes .
that ’ s a matter of opinion .
we have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot .
yeah . how's everything going ?
yes , a lot of friends .
it ’ s my mother . she ’ s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father .
really . for me too .
oh . yes . it is
that ’ s a good idea
i feel it ’ s rather dry here
i see . so this is your hometown ?
yes , of course . it was nice to see you .
sounds good . the food there is fantastic too .
don't give up so soon .
so you are not sure how long it will take to get there ?
don't forget it's friday nighty . if frankfurt's anything like london , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . it will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly .
he is a worker .
she is a nurse .
good . i was thinking that i ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
yes , certainly . how can i help you ?
yes , besides it versa according to the distance .
yes , i've got the address .
take it easy . i'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
come on , ted ! don't be such a chicken . if you like her , you ’ ve got to tell her . maybe she likes you .
no . i've been visiting relatives recently .
great . let's talk over coffee .
oh , congratulations ! sounds like you ’ ve found your soul mate .
new york times . i read it everyday .
full of energy and hope .
certainly it is . it's worth an academy award .
oh , great !
i like no . 4 .
i like it a lot . it has a very funny beginning , i think . it attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it .
yeah ! it reminds me of the previous star wars scenes .
for instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
is she coming ?
but many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough .
it's time to go . bye , ella . hope to see you soon .
oh , hi !
see you around !
yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ?
yeah , i don't mind it either . we ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ?
he said that i have been eating too much .
what's the occasion ? you won the lottery ?
yes , we got wet through . but we still enjoyed ourselves .
tell me about it ! it's like the whole world is broiling .
i hope it's not gonna break into three digits
i hope so too .
i do . right now i have it protected up to 30 below zero .
i missed today's weather forecast over the tv .
the ice will soon be thick enough for skating . i am so fond of winter sports .
lizzy who ?
it doesn ’ t matter . oh , god , i have only four dollars in my wallet . is that possible for me to buy one ?
you do ?
so you are .
oh , just looking at these club notices . i'm thinking of joining one . hey why don't we join a club together ? how about the tennis club ?
a millionaire ? as a jazz musician ?
un . i think it can be a time waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see . mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching .
tomorrow afternoon would be fine .
total fitness , why ?
i ’ m a defender . it ’ s a lot of fun . you don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .
no . as far as i can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to lisbon .
oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement .
just so so . where did you get it ?
i go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually i watch it on tv .
great . let's go .
the only thing i can do now is waiting for another chance .
no , not yet . i'm really worried .
what do you mean ?
yes , i found a very good job down there .
ok . i'll drop you a line as soon as i get there .
right . since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too .
$ 14 , 500 . it only has 10 , 000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car .
yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution .
yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red .
but the summer isn't . it's scorching in the summer .
are you chinese by birth ?
i think you are absolutely right . actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
i jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . you know i never realized how hard it is to run on sand . i couldn ’ t get through a whole game before i had to sit down .
absolutely ! everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on .
go ahead .
it's october the 1st , our national day . i'd like to talk some more , but i've got to get going now . it was nice talking to you , though .
my grandfather did that too . he used the time to study instead .
yes , sure . what time will the wedding begin ?
and would you like salad ? the salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives .
larry drives a truck . he drives all over the country . we hardly ever seen him .
mm ?
you ’ re right . i wasn ’ t . i hear nothing .
you know on a date , they are going to dinner .
that ’ s right , once a week . do you want to order some pizza ?
i went back for it . but it was already gone .
i hope not . then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game .
is your waist any better ?
really ? well , i guess i have to get used to it .
about what ?
okay .
baby , come on . don ’ t do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! don ’ t leave me .
i'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday .
it's his 50th birthday .
sure . hey , i'm sorry , but i've got to get going .
bye !
what kind of movie is it ? i don ’ t like many of his movies , actually .
i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes .
sure . take a seat . what would you like to know ?
i think you should give them some credit . they ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves
i know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , i think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds .
what do you have in mind ?
well , i studied french at school , but i ’ ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your pa
it gets better on sunday , though . the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . it will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . the west coast will be experiencing some
not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ?
sure ! how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ?
it ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off .
cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon .
oh , nothing much really . and how is everything with you ?
they're both very well , thanks .
i'm glad to help you . what's wrong ?

what happened ?
you know , i think you ’ re awesome .
you have always been so soft , dave !
that ’ s right bill . we will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . that ’ s the weather forecast for this morning .
xu spikes it ! wow , what a great hit ! the brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !
no , not at all . i was on the swimming team in high school . and i'd like to do some weight training . they have decent equipment at that gym .
i want to see the museums , and i want to shop a lot .
relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .
i don ’ t know . i didn ’ t really feel like going out . i guess i ’ m feeling a little homesick .
kobi bryant and shaquille o ’ neal , they are the los angeles lakers ’ star players .
a little , but the rush was worth it .
okay . a pint of heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! and what about some appetizers ?
yes , of course . didn't you know that ?
right there .
so how much do you want to gamble ?
well , i agree with you . i'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . i just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population .
son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys . they ’ re dangerous !
yeah well it ’ s about time ! he ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !
i agree . and probably the automobile companies are too powerful . they never allowed the government to develop trains .
thank you for reminding me . i'll continue to exercise as soon as i finish this project .
then you've got a lot of homework to do . you need to get her notice first .
i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
will there be a lot of people there ?
oh , i thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?
i'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday .
bye !
i see how that can get a bit annoying .
that'd be great . what time should i meet you there ?
sure , what's on ?
jump in , i'll give you a ride .
come on ! we're traveling on our own . it won't cost too much .
i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
i agree . you can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need .
oh , it is really far from here . you ’ re going in the wrong direction actually .
yeah , and most excitingly , i met the girl living under me today . she's really nice .
ah . that can wait . your promotion is the best news i've heard in a long time !
why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ?
i want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer .
no , but i'd like to . do you have to pay to do instant messaging ?
yes , but i don't really use it that often . have you ever used it ?
how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ?
pretty well . i don't know if i'll get the promotion or not , but i feel good about it .
you said it . ok , let's go in , sandy .
so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? i don't know how well that will go over .
that ' s really good . it's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work .
art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table .
well , it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost b
when did you learn to dance ?
maybe i've got a higher eq . i'm not sure .
well , if you want we can go together sometime . actually i was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and i can show you the neighborhood along the way .
well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me .
yeah , i remember the neighborhood . have you found a place yet ?
i don't think dieting is good for you . it's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with !

i don't know when i can come . i'll let you know later .
wouldn't you ? what would you do with all that spare time ?
good gracious ! what's that ?
he appeals to the fans thanks to two things
crazy !
not really . sometimes , i even let other people make key decision for me .
i usually meet some friends and we play sports together or i might spend some time alone on my hobbies . i spend winter evening watching tv , but i spend summer evening at cultural events if i have time
what a pity . i believe it's a very good film .
thanks , how about the green and black one ?
sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it , our space shuttles are ufos .
thank you all the same .
you got me on that one .
i like the colour very much . it's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me .
i wish i were , but i am deadly serious . she said you invited her to dinner last week .
what about this one ? this one's got a label .
when will the new people move into this house ?
yes , please . i'd like a cigarette , too . may i have one ?

how can i ever thank you ? i owe you a big favor .
i ’ m a firefighter .
no way ! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24 7 . you know , i don't think i've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . what do you think fo the one child policy
that's true . but as a woman , i'm glad that even though i don't want any children , i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand , i can't imagine what china would be like
romantic ? i can ’ t remember what that word means .
thanks , that'd be nice . when's the next ice hockey game on ?
thanks ! we love it .
i ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it !
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood .
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .

yes , are you ?
i know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . anyway , i don't wanna part . i'll drop by tomorrow .

yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother .
well . yes , but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i'm not as shy as i think . anyway , you're certainly not shy !
not really . i like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i ’ m buying before i pay for it . sometimes , i ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat
the trains aren't usually full . we can get them on the day we travel . we should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .

sorry to hear that ! but i would definitely recommend this place !

not very well .
very badly , doctor .
yes , doctor . ( the doctor examines the patient )
well , yes , i did . i ate some candy .
i have been feeling great , dr . smith .
what is wrong with you ?
be brave , sir . it won't be long . i will fill out the form for you . what is your name ?
what doesn ’ t feel right ?
yes , here you are .
yes , i know . it ’ s not the first time i ’ m taking this ! don ’ t worry , i won ’ t overdose !
let me see . roll up your sleeve , please . um . it's swollen and red here . i'm afraid we'll need to take an x ray to see if it's broken .
good . now the other eye .
yes , occasionally .
will i need stitches ?
would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ?
certainly . i recommend this medicine . it's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . and it helps just as much . in fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , i promise .
a little , but not much .
please wait till your name is called . ok . your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 day supply of medicine . it comes to one hundred yuan .
great ! what floor is pharmacy on ?
it's my honor , mr . mike . by the way , how can i know whether i am accepted or not ?
yes . thank you very much . i am looking forward to hearing from you .
it's easy . is there anything i can do for you , sir ?
what about taking the prints in two shipments ? two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later .
but we have only moderate mean at hand . if you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it .
you are welcome . have a nice day .
sorry to interrupt , doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ?
well , the reason why i am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . and the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back .
can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ?
sure .
is that true ? i can't believe it . there are always some meetings in this company .
thank you , sir .
i ’ m not so satisfied with it .
yes , i applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed .
thanks a lot ! i will look forward to the good news . please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning .
just one . i noticed an item about flextime . is that a possibility for me ?
i am james pond from fam company and i am here to discuss it with nova .
i suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . in this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . in my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much .
well , i understand .
during my trip here , i learned a lot and i get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . i can feel and sense the potential of your company . and at last i wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful .
it is a pretty big mechanical company . i am assigned to work in the assembly shop .
i will set it up .
if you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . but cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking .
is the price negotiable ?
we will check with the parties concerned right away .
when will i know your decision ?
i worked in a foreign representative office for one year . however , i leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . i found another job that was more interesting .
before we discuss the price , may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
that's wonderful . i appreciate your efficiency and cooperation .
thank you .
i will , good luck .
how much does it pay ?
not necessarily . it depends on the contract stipulations . they may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country .
say it .
can you deliver them earlier ?
i see .
all right . what time are you coming ?
i'm afraid not . why don't you call the help desk ? someone there will be able to help you .
we've taken on a civil engineer on a nine month temporary contract . he'll oversee the whole project . in fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . why don't you join us ?
yes , you have a paid month holiday every year .
no , that's all .
what about early next week ?
thank you again . i'll keep doing my best .
of course . a two week paid vacation a year , a five day workweek .
no problem .
i do a forty hour week . i ’ m on flexi time . i usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4
i know , and that's why i'm always respectful and i keep my distance . it's safer that way .
i believe i would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours .
for over forty years . the original company davies engineering was founded in 1960 by the davies brothers in a small workshop near manchester . they closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in leeds .
we try to recycle as much as we can .
this is mr . smith of xyz company . when will he be back ?
yes , i told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend .
yes , i did . besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . i think you'll have to do some replies .
no problem . i will do it immediately .
not really . we need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers .
455623 .
could you put me through to dan aykroyd ?
well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . we try to replace components before they fail or wear out . this prevents the equipment from breaking down . it also saves us a lot of trouble !
it depends what it is . once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . if there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . but if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time .
don't take it too hard . there are some tips you should know in job hunting of 2010 .
you'll find our prices very favorable .
i'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
it's all or nothing .
yes , there have been a few problems recently . why don't you call the it department ?
if you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . make sure you use the right extinguisher . they are all colour coded and contain different substances to put out the fire .
well , shall we get down to business ' .
i was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions , training them in speech and organism , carrying our massage and physiotherapy , taking care of patients ' nutrition and diet .
yes , i did . i got 600 in toefl and 2 , 300 in gre .
don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
ok . then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . you'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . is that agreeable to you ?
that's all ?
of course not . my school record was above average in my class .
i am a good accountant and have a thorough knowledge of the english language .
ok . would you like to file them according to dates ?
i think i can figure this out . let's see if this works as advertised . say ' cheese ! '
what do they like or dislike . what languages do they speak , what religions do they follow .
thank you . that's a long way to go for my job .
it's nine o'clock now . and i'll wait for him .
bye !
sure , what's wrong ?
ok !
ok , let's sign it .
that's great .
a little over 3 years .
fine . i have your letter and i've made some notes .
i don't think i have any problem with our chinese partners . they have always followed the contract strictly . we can do business directly with the corporation . as i mentioned before , the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
i stick to my principles and keep to the rules . sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and i get them involved with something constructive . some of them change their attitude later .
yes , i have , mr . thomas . we'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton .
ok , no problem .
well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy .
ideally , i ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . i ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . i actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . but i realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and i have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting .
probably routine , dull work . oh , i am much more enthusiastic if i'm given a challenge and responsibility .
that's no problem . i know that every company has busy periods . when this happens , i'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done .
because you're going to love this show !
i had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . because i've had a number of bosses , i've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . it's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . my last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when i helped her accomplish her goals .
the time period is set on june 29th .
i have experience in computer operation , proficiency in microsoft windows , microsoft word and microsoft excel .
we are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable . we assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care .
well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
all right . in my first teaching position i received the ' excellent teaching ' award the past two years in succession .
working hard and being frugal are both virtues . i strive to practise these two virtues in my life .
as a trial order , i'll take 5 , 000 dozen this time .
thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
no , i haven ’ t had any professional experience , but i have always been interested in creative writing .
i think so .
all right !
i'm afraid i can't discuss that over the phone .
buy a decent suit .
yes , i'd like to give it a try .
can i give her a message for you ?
of course . first you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
gladly , 8962105 2 .
i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , i can ’ t send out this e mail . do you have the number of the text port ?
i try to adapt myself .
i'm afraid not , but can you make it thursday afternoon ?
i have to say your education and experience are very outstanding , but it seems that you are not good at working in a team which we attach great importance to .
ok , thank you , i'll try if there were other chances .
yes . i have published some articles in china daily and economist .
i like almost all sports , and i enjoy both playing and watching . i especially like tennis and mountain climbing .
my chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends .
i believe every company has its own salary criterion . and you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances .
you ’ d better not . informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
yes , some . but be aware that different people may like different scents .
i see .
of course , here you are , sir .
that ’ s true , but still the herald lists some jobs the globe doesn ’ t have .
oh , dear . how can i wait for such a long time ?
no problem .
i'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right .
don ’ t mention it . see you .
no , nothing in particular . thank you .
i ’ ll do my best , but sometimes i have trouble being myself in stressful situations .
yes , sir . it is jane . it was given by my english professor when i was at the university .
ok .
of course , here you are , sir .
yes , it's true .
working for your company , as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! just ask me if you need any help .
in the dining room . it's spacious there .
i have a typical nine to five job . actually , i work a little longer than nine to five most days .
what do you mean ?
$ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer .
what's up ?
why are you interested in the position ?
your job objectives , of course . in other words , what kind of job are you searching for ?
say if the engineering department wants to hire a person , they will request hr to find candidates .
thanks , mary . you ’ re a real pal . i'll call now to set up an interview .
i want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future .
most willingly . it's 600 dollars per ton .
then , i am sorry to say i must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers .
i wish to have a job in which i can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement . and your company meets all my requirements .
ok . there are five people in my family , father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and i .
what education background do the employees usually have ?
yes , i am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends .
i'm sorry i can't , because i haven't finished my thesis .
hello , dana , this is kevin abrahams from eureka corp . i don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the chamber of commerce luncheon .
that's cool . what documents do i need to carry ?
how about your academic records at college ?
how would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
bye .
i am looking for a more challenging position . i can ’ t grow anymore in my current job .
more and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort .
yes . our price can't be matched .
15 dollars per dozen
well , not in so many words . but i know that productivity is a big issue for him . oh , he said the usual things like “ keep up the good work ” and “ thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . that , to me , means he's not satisfied with what i've been doing .
confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly .
it can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer .
some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . will this company do so ?
i have earned 10 , 000 a year including bonuses .
thank you . it's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place .
and it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary .
but remind you , there are some forbidden activities .
we have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis .
yes . floating bonus is the kind of bonus that is indeterminate in amount , such as quarterly bonus , bonus at the end of the year .
hello , this is wang li . i want to know the status of the position .
yes , i will . i hope i'll enjoy working with you .
we'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible .
i think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job .
ok , i will .
what's wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
i don ’ t think he ’ s back today .
thanks .
i've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
yes , i'm from salt lake city .
bye .
yes , i'm now working in a company .
i'll be glad to do it .
this is mr . gao . how are you ?
excuse me , what business are you looking after in germany ?
sure , i'll certainly help you do it .
i try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . sometimes you just have to grin and bear it .
sure .
will the train be very crowded ?
thanks . it ’ s nothing special actually .
i'm sorry to hear that . may we meet the day after tomorrow ?
did i do something wrong ?
no , that's not good either . but give me your phone number and i'll call you if somebody cancels .
i'd love to come other time if it can be arranged .
that's great .
ok . what sort of agent , exactly ?
good . i'll be there at 12:30 .
and how many accounts would i handle ?
you should wear a formal dress and be confident .
so how to apply for a job on the internet ?
i will give it a try at once .
they want to recommend some jobs to me .
you are welcome .
not exactly . our address is ' www . zhilian zhaopin . com . cn ' .
what kind of intermediary is it ?
what job did he recommend to you ?
it was nice to have you with us .
goodbye .
never mind .
that's quite all right .
our personnel clerk will screen all the resumes that we receive , select the eligible ones and arrange the interview for them .
i taught english in a primary school in beijing .
first of all , as far as i know , your company has had impressive records in business . second , i want to enter the foreign trade field .
all right .
ah , good morning , mr . smith . nice to meet you . i'm peter anderson from personnel . do sit down .
yes . i ’ d be delighted if you did .
he is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him .
not too bad , i suppose .
look , i want to succeed just as much as you do . well , maybe not quite that much .
i know how it works . you don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to .
what ’ s your name , please ?
i saw your green post it notes . nobody else has them .
i know , i know . kill , or die , right ?
right . and that would be a total giga bummer .
well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . and you don't work well with other employees .
we can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign .
and what about that man there ?
in 2004 , i got a job in the sales department of a trading company near guangzhou . i started a sales representative . a year later , i was promoted to the position of sales manager . i had that job ever since , which is just over a year now .
nice to meet you , austin .
thank you , sir . i'll try my best to assist richard in his work .
no one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before . maybe i should learn to do something .
twenty .
i like sports very much . besides that , i also like working on a computer in my spare time .
yes , i would .
well . then , 260 yuan each .
i like the novels of dickens very much , i have reading almost all of them in chinese translation , i wish i can reading them in the original .
all right , madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent .
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily .
i've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
i ’ ll see you then . good bye .

i am , sir .
i see myself in a management position .
ok , i am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into . we will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
i think i ’ m very good at planning . i manage my time perfectly , so that i can always get things done on time .
i ’ ve been a secretary for two years , before that i was at university .
yes , here is the form for an expense report . fill it out and give it to me . i ’ ll get it signed for you .
thanks , monica . without support from you and other colleagues , i would not have made it .
i really appreciate it . thank you .
yes . by the way , you are having a great make up today . i like the color of your lipstick . so adorable !
what do you need ?
well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say , the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
what for ? oh , i see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the south korea market .
sure , no problem . but i need something from you .
i agree .
that's fine . see you then .
i appreciate your help .
and the winner is . vivian , again ! i don't believe it !
let's meet on friday to discuss your progress . give me your e mail address . umm , i mean addresses . we'll be in touch .
well , as you know rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . you could be on call at any time . we do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
i understand . and are there other bonuses included ?
and i saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . i really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions .
have you decided ?
ok .
i like talking to writers , i get to meet a lot of interesting people .
really ? it's nice to meet you . how long have you been with this company ?
now let me show you around . this is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . over there is the sales department .
i tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard . just kidding . oh , your cubicle is over the . and this way . those are all private offices the managers ' offices .
oh , really ? would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ?
i see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . the staff here must be comfortable . i think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees .
first , as far as i know , your company has had an impressive growth record . second , i want to get into the foreign trade business .
well , not exactly , but i have shown some of my foreign friends around beijing .
football . it's a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and i also enjoying the team spirit of football .
what is the salary while on probation ?
not at all . go ahead .
ok , where can i find their telephone number ?
how old is he ?
what ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ?
didn't you hear about that ? our meeting was proponed until friday .
i know , but i am really sick .
i just sense . but i cannot grow anymore . my boss is not really supporting me . i am interested in some positions in other jv companies , but i need to do some more in step research before i send my application letters out .
i ’ ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . depend on my work qualifications and experience , i would like to have 5000 yuan to start .
so if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ?
i second .
marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . all together , there will be 15 events .
understanding comes from product differentiation . we get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like .
sorry , i have no idea . you can call him there if you like .
i ’ ll make sure he gets the message .
i am looking for a more challenging position . i can ’ t grow anymore in my current job .
i work quite well with a team . i ’ m a good team player . i respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . and i will do my best to help team members .
sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . you deserved it !
well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks .
what ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
quite a lot . all them one afternoon ?
just a minute please . i ’ ll make a call to the hr office . yes , they confirm your appointment . please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . you can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today .
no , sir . the plant expansion project has been delayed . there was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits . it seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species .
what about the senior account managers ? do they count ?
well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . you ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports .
mitsubishi , hp , ibm and many other famous corporations .
oh , no , you can't be serious . i never expect anything like this would happened . what are we going to do ?
no , and let me tell you why . if i make my guys stay over to check the inventory , i'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . i estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % . if you need the numbers that urgently , i can have them do it . otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and i'll call you with the numbers after they're done . it's your call .
yes , he knows i'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
that would be very nice . thank you .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
sure , what i can do for you ?
ok , i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ?
you know , i think the fax machine is out of toner , i can change the toner cartridge . that should solve the problem .
to encourage the staff increases .
let me check . it has a paper jam .
i did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . i asked her if i could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . it turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . i took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
em , as i have said , i'm diligent and industrious . on the other hand , sometimes i'm too hard working and i put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect .
to work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . that is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive .
i will receive a bachelor's degree .
sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . but we should be making the decision by the end of this week . and we'll get in touch with you once we make it .
what did you do ?
a laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments .
i know ! it ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! they ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development .
yes , in this position i was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . with the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue .
that's all right . but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime ?
oh , to tell you the truth , i love the sky . when i was a child , i imagined flying into the blue sky some day . now , i think the day has come . my dream will come true . and i like travelling very much and i enjoy working with people .
i have passed the five courses required by the chinese cpa association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . how about that ?
for the past 3 years , i have been working in china east airlines corporation limited . i'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . i feel i have a lot to offer as a team member .
no , i know how to control my temper .
i think you'll find i'm worth that .
yes , it is quite reasonable .
to speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me .
i know it is a crucial position , but i can do it well . so i'm asking for 200 , 000 yuan a year as a starting salary .
from video tv .
no , i am still single .
well , i'll cancel your appointments for today . and i'll tell mr . morley .
well , maybe we'll go to ask mr . johnson . he has the final say .
all right , all right . he'll get them as soon as possible .
sure , what is it ?
i ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . then i ’ ll start looking for a new position .
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . i'd like to postpone that decision until later .
i am more interested in a full time position . however , i would also consider a part time position .
i like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . moreover , i am familiar with cad . but i can do any mechanic well if i am employed .
i am a senior mechanical design engineer .
what about my resume ?
we are glad to hear that . what items are you particularly interested in ?
yes , mr . ransom ? this is karl miller . how may i help you ?
certainly , sir . just tell me your account number please .
that's quite all right .
wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly .
i'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . would there ever be any chance of that ?
will you need anything special for the presentation ?
no , i've tried them . but i'm not really a smoker .
here's what i propose . i think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
that is good of you to say so . when can you start working ?
mr green , please .
no , thanks . i'll call back later .
i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
i'm sorry , he's out at the moment .
certainly , sir . there ’ s a flight at 8: 35 a . m . and one at 10 .
she seems to be quite qualified . if it ’ s a personal problem , i ’ d prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves .
two boxes of transparencies for the over head machines .
i ’ m in a bit of a hurry , louise . can it wait ?
yes . ms . gray . is there something wrong ?
that ’ s all right . bring me over what you ’ ve got .
hello , chris . how can i help you ?
right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible . but employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues .
you mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ?
no , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . however by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention
i hope you enjoyed your stay .
what ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ?
ok . see you at your office at 2:30 .
that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me .
why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ?

great ! then i suppose i'm looking forward to my first promotion , too .
as well my company has been very supportive about my decision . they ' ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies .
