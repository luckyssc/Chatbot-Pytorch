my brother gave me a baby cat yesterday . i can keep it as my pet .
my child is often absent minded in class .
good evening , madam . may i help you ?

well , that's ok .
what color do you like ?
anything else ?
i'll prepare that . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
where ? i don't see it .
i beg your pardon ?
yes . the stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . you can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well .
i'm afraid i have to return this sweater .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
i dislike my roommate . he really turns me off .
yes , we do .
i do wish i could lose weight
excuse me . do you know how to get to the mall ?
yeah , but that's human nature .
can i help you ?
i also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . which shelf are they on ? i can't find the number .

i wish i had a dog . my cat can't do any tricks .
i want to buy a shirt .
where's my book ?
the dictionary .
where are my shoes ?
what about the divided skirt ?
good habit . how long does it take ?
about 12 . she is a good girl .
we have darker ones . do you like the style ?
i know , i left it at home .
i like chess better than xiangqi . and you ?
yeah . oh well , how about a game of cards instead ?
this is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture .
really ?
it's the automatic teller machine .
it sure is , but i'm going to call hp first , just to make sure .
this one is also really cool . it's a sci fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . the graphics on this one are spectacular .
certainly i can . i'll buy some from the butcher's and cook for you next sunday .
this is no . 1 bus , bound for sihun .
may i take your order ?
but he always wimps out of difficulty .
did you put the blue bin out on the street ?
then you pretended to go without buying it ?
oh , how awful ! may i have a look at the invoice ?
you look fresh recently . how do you make it ?
yes . behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . young people easily become blind worshippers of a westernized life . while they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high consumption places .
what does that imply , then ?
what reasons do westerners drink for ?
it ’ s slow . hurry up ! the bus goes at twenty to eight .
oh , here comes a bus !
that's nice . do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?
my mp3 player is broken , so i want to change it for an mp4 player . can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?
oh , that's a good idea . perhaps i should have a try .
sounds reasonable .

the same is true for ' my hero ' . winners of the contest used to star in the tv series ' the frog prince ' .
what's the house rent ? when is the rent due ? and how much security deposit do you require ?
let's see . we spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month .
right . stop thinking about it . where do you think we can save more money ?
how about this scarf , these earrings , amd an anklet ?
that's what i thought you would do . listen , i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it's just down the street from all the bars . you probably don't want to be walking around after dark .
i know . but we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . window shopping won ’ t cost you anything .
well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
yeah , you are right . tell me your normal diet .
steven , what's the expense of moving house ?
i ’ d buy this if it were cheaper . how about 5 000 yuan ?
good morning . welcome to time after time watches .
let's see how much the bill is .
well , i always order fried spring rolls when i go to chinatown .
you know , sometimes i can't feel my ears and fingers .
yes , but it ’ s not free , you have to pay .
well there is an important meeting with a new client .
yes . i am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
what was that ?
it's very windy today .
actually , i haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . let ’ s do that then .
let's all go together then .
is that the japanese restaurant ?
ok . now how can i help , hon ?
what is your policy on returns ?

bill black , room 1201 .
oh . henry . i haven't seen you in ages . come in . let me take your coat . how are you getting along ?
they're soft .
can i get your phone number ?
and your address ?
sure . it's a popular dish among young ladies .
we have three kinds of dressings for salad . italian , french and thousand island . which one would you like ?
hi , i'm here to look at the one bedroom apartment you have for rent .
do you want a taxi ?
yes , of course . step in , please !
hey , ann , i am really sorry about last night . i shouldn't have said those things to you .
well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ?
well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand , when i wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . for me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . though i don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody .
how many rooms are you looking for ?
thanks for the warning .
sure .
you are free . you can go now .
what is it ?
what's the matter ?
where did you have it done ?
sally , what do we have for dinner
after all , she is a five year old kid .
i ’ d like to make a collect call to beijing china , please .
hello , towing service . what ’ s your problem ?
excuse me , sir ?
i like to apologize for the problem . please come down with your receipt and sweater to exchange it for the size you want .
what dressing would you like on the salad ?
yes , of course . the guest speaker is professor david of a university , and he'll be lecturing about the impact of the oil crisis on latin america .
not at all . i ’ ll be glad to do it .
can i give you a lift home , mrs . word ?
dreadful . there , the door is open now .
maybe we'd better go now .
great ! thank you !
l'm sorry . all the black of that size are sold out . would you like a red one ?
i think mum should not take sides . after all , we are all her children .
but i don't even know what to study .
yes , i think so . there is also an interesting one . it ' s opposite the park .
yes , i'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . make it hot , please .
what ’ s your address , your name and your phone number ?
oh , yes . here it is .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
excuse me , do the buses stop here ?
i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
excuse me . is this where i catch the bus for the zoo ?
at least five channels have morning cartoons on saturdays .
you used to do this by yourself ?
you ’ re welcome . bye .
hello .
are you all right ?
that's right .
can you tell me the way to the peak tram , please ?
come to think of it , there is one rule in this house , mary .
excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
say , jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?
sure . but there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . if your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge .
well , it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ?
white and whole wheat .
this is mr . stewart . who ’ s this ?
i'll do my best .
yes . will you take me to the station ?
good , morning ! can i help you ?

tall building . which side is the building on ?
trust me . i've been driving for two years .
please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . please roll down your window .
really ? but i can smell alcohol on your breath . blow into this breathalyzer , please .
your bac exceeds the legal limit .
not , if you don ’ t want to .
oh , this way please . what size do you wear ?
here you are , madam . all these are sixteens .
what ’ s the matter , dear ?
shall i right out again first ?
is it far ?
shall we have some soup first ?
no , madam . i don't think i do .
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
taxi ! taxi !
is it a long run to the station ?
this is the rush hour .
sorry , it's not available now . anything else ?
would you please teach me how to use the computer ?
let's start to study how to use computers , paubler . it ' s good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software .
yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover . which would you want to buy ?
is this the right bus for the grand hotel ?
the cathedral ?
how many rooms are you looking for ?

what would happen if they started attacking you ?
do i have to turn on the computer ?
it ’ s slow . hurry up ! the bus goes at twenty to eight .
may i buy a ticket here at the station ?
not right now . i've got to get another car and my old one is blown up .
that's not the point . come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
how frustrating ! the bus is still not coming .
dad , where is the book building ?
oh , dad , look at the sign , please !
would you please take a seat over there ? there are some interesting magazines on the coffee table .
we have discount coupons . 100 yuan for ten times . would you like to have one ?
do you think it's suitable for me ?
how old is she ?
thank you , 175 yuan .
sorry , sir , it's my job to make sure the goods are paid .
i want to have a try later .
ah . i see .
hey , look out !
what about the damage to my car ? what are you gonna do about that ?

why don ’ t you help me save money ? you are always spending money .
yes . they should check the elevator regularly . i have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .

what about a two bedroom house ?
how is this going ?

yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see .
yes , i'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . make it hot , please .
i like miniskirt .
are you going home now ?
now darling , i know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . i think we should sell it .
since this is a white t shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
it ’ s just the right size a perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
freeze ! police ! put your hands over your head !
we've found some heroin at your house .
well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
what happened ?
great ! would you like your second pizza to be these as the first ?
a crate of beer ? why do we need that ?
are the reports favorable ?
if you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment .
i like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .

can you fix me a cup of tea , johnny ?
well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma .
so where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ?
hey , susan . have you got a sec ? i have some questions about my paycheck .
that's right . below the federal deductions are the state deductions . there's the state income tax , and then this sui / sdi tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take .
well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive in burger joint .
my mother taught me some tricks of the trade . i've always loved jewelry .
bruno bistro , how may i help you ?
certainly sir , for which day and time please ?
how about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! better yet , let's order some hot dogs !
yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes .
sounds like fun ! when we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox .
what's for dinner ?
we have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
they don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . the heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's chi .

seven and a half .
you can't be serious .

we also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .

eating here or to go ?

i like one taken half length .
that's all right . thank you .
so click here , then up to the top .
hello !
hi , i'd like two tickets to providence , please .
ok , could you give me two tickets for that ?

wow . that girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! i wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast .
are you still hungry , ryan ? how about some more squid balls ?
wow ! you really like fruit , huh ? you've already had 3 plates !
but there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
isn't this fun ?
that's not why . this way i can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
definitely . every year . but just for our forty person class .
you don't sound too excited about going to your reunion .
excuse me , are there any more shopping carts ?
thanks . let me see . i think there's a mistake on the bill here . would you mind checking , please ?

well , actually i'd like to buy some vitamins for my son . he's five months old . can you suggest any ?
excuse me , i got a parcel arrival notice yesterday .
500 us dollars .

yes , i do .
that is the most boring , typical gift in the world !
all right . over here , sir . how are you today ?
and would you like to order now ?
here is the menu .

ok , wait a moment please .
we have various colors . how about this one ?
how about this brown one ?
i recommend pioneer .
no , but we have it in yellow .
with the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . i think this model may be just what i'm looking for .
no . i would rather just return it .
i do it , too . you know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . and if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . he does it very often . i really get mad . i can ’ t help spank him sometimes .
thank you . but i will call her later .
sure here it is .
ok . what are we having ?
a house would be great . i could plant a garden . and you could use the garage for a workshop .
we're ready to order . a cup of coffee for me , and a glass of oranges for her .
not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ?
i see . thank you .
study hard , otherwise you'll fail .
oh , sure . i'll be back in a minute . thank you for waiting . here it is . did you enjoy your meal ?
yeah , it looks like we ’ re in for a long drive .
oh , it hasn ’ t been painted yet .
that would be fine .

well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge .
what do you want ?
hey , don ’ t walk on the lawn .
take me to this address , please .
hello , i bought the pendant in your shop , just before .
ok , let's think about it for a minute .
the tape player doesn ’ t work .
yes , it is pretty , but it costs $ 200 . what about this one ? it ’ s almost the same , but it costs half as much .
well , it ’ s your money . you can spend it however you want . do you really think it ’ s pretty ?
rachel jason .
can i help you , sir ?
that's fine . please call again later .
hello , anna speaking !
yes , emergency . there is a huge fire here .

so what's wrong with the drain ?
i know . i ’ ve got to get it fixed asap .
if you refuse the blow , you'll receive a ticket and your vehicle will be impounded .
would you please wait a minute ? i will get one for you at once .
55 dollars , madam .
yes , madam ? can i help you ?
oh , let's see . . . about six .
could i speak to mary , please ?
your own kids would get suzy's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i don't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .
we also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones .
we can buy a three liter bottle . it works out cheaper per liter . we should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
yes . behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . young people easily become blind worshippers of a westernized life . while they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish
i'm sorry . i don't know .
that's nice . do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ?
cindy , you're so cute .
i have a little white cat .
absolutely . believe it or not , i found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago .
here you are .
try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice .
that's cool . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but i'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
where did you empty the basket , bill ?
ok , here you are . anything else ?
you're welcome . have a nice day .
please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
well , that depends . when is it ?
taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
may i help you ?
yes , we do , debit or credit ?
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
hi , excuse me sir ? i ’ m looking for a dress shoe . my usual pair that i ’ ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . they don ’ t provide any support anymore .
i ’ ve decided to grow my own garden !
sure do ! this one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas !
i'm glad we came here . this is really delicious !
i've never used this place before . can you give me some idea what i need to do ?
no . never .
that's good .
here's the number , 256 4367 .
can i help you ?
i'm lucky i wasn't killed . i must have been going around forty five miles an hour . there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out .
make it tighter . i want the blood stopped . then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk .
it doesn't work . it looks like it's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
yes , that's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper , and now i can't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
can you finish your homework in ten minutes ?
i'm sorry i scratched your car .
i'd like you to do me a favor .
o . k . thanks . i ’ ll let you know what i find .
do you sell washing machines ?
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? i don ’ t think i can finish everything in time .
actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . i made far too much food to eat alone . i am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
hello , barneys garage .
i have been washing the dishes for over a week now .
do you have a big yard ?
the what ?
would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ?
i won't be long . no more than ten minutes . why don't you go ahead and i'll meet you in the park ?
it ’ s just the right size a perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ?
it looks too big for you , but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
small ? but it should be enough for our needs , i think .
that ’ s way too much money .
good morning . i ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . could you help me ?
oh , i am not sure i even want to look at this house !
what do you think about the apartment so far ?
you don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ?
do you like the apartment ?
i could use some help on moving day . what are you doing on saturday ?
yes , i would love to see the apartment .
yes , i can be there at 6 .
the owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month .
i'm interested in the apartment on main street .
so , let ’ s see . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam
i think you ’ ve done a very good job . as least as good as a professional would do . perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
when did it first break down ?
the early bird gets the worm .
can you tell me how much i would have to pay for rent ?
how much more ?
it ’ s only $ 725 a month .
tonight is a party night ! what drinks do you think we need ?
would you like a super size meal ? only 2 rib more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . and today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
that ’ s a nice dress . it ’ s very smart .
give me some glasses please , jane .
yes , please .
okay , i think that i understand .
hello ! we ’ ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . did you forget our order ?
i know it's old , but what make is it ?
net really , no . we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street .
skim , please . that'd be very nice . thanks . oh no . janna , i'm so sorry , but i've got to go .
that's amazing ! has she bitten you yet ?
that's what i want . for exercising at the club . i can even spend 100 dollars on them . i don't care .
no , but she exercises more than me .
that sounds good . i'm going to start with an italian tiramisu .
it's nice , but it's rather plain . do you want to try my tiramisu ?
and i can choose any color ?
well , we have many models to choose from here . do you have a particular brand you want ?
well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let's talk about your
that's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and word processing , and that is what students mostly do . ma
morgan , can i ask you a question ?
what kind of dishes do you usually make ?
do you make a lot of traditional british food ?
how ’ s that ?
remember , no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
that's right . i thought i'd come back to buy some more souvenirs .
same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
oh dear . well , i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
is this the only kind you have ?
ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ?
it was about 75 years old . there were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .
any other ideas ?
this way , please . here they are . they're all handmade .
healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . so we are free to have whatever foods we love . it is unbelievable .
what's wrong , officer ?
i did ?
take a left .
the machines take change ?
do you know how late it is ?
i can't go home yet , because i have things to do here .
sure , what kind do you like ?
i want to get a snack at the cafeteria .
what kind do you want ?
what do you plan on buying ?
i think i may try to eat a little better .
how do you stick to only those foods ?
so , what do you feel like eating then ?
do you know what you want to eat for lunch ?
what's for dinner tonight ?
i may just do that .
i was thinking of pizza .
yeah , that sounds delicious .
if you don't mind , i would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription .
i believe so .
when will it be working again ?
do i still have to pay for the cable ?
we have a special where you can order a second appetizer for half price .
you know , that is one of my favorites !
yes , we have a wide selection of mixed drinks available from our bar .
i've been craving chicken and potatoes .
i'll cook dinner .
i don't like green apples .
what kind of apples do you prefer ?
i like salads with croutons , almonds , and shredded cheese .
the only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle .
how long have you been a bus driver ?
you have a lot to get done this morning .
okay , i'll let you sleep for a little while longer .
which one would you recommend ?
were there any injuries ?
i had no idea that i ran it .
yes , madam .
thanks for being so understanding .
that's really all i have to do ?
why is that ?
yeah , i think that's what i'm going to have to do .
didn't i ask you to clean it up earlier ?
i thought i asked you to clean your room earlier .
remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything .
i would like to get that .
could you send someone to fix it today ?
hi , how are you ?
you can't finish in less than three days .
is it my choice as to who inspects this house ?
i haven't taken it yet .
so , i passed ?
did they accept the counter offer ?
so , when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance ?
that would be great .
do you have a pen that i can use ?
i really need to apply for a driving permit .
pay it off , and they'll clear your record .
i parked in the red zone .
i need to buy a bus pass .
it was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago .
i agree , it's just never on time .
i need some flowers for my wife . it's her birthday .
you have to give it back to me .
will you still throw me out if i make the rent payment ?
if i catch up on my rent , can i stay ?
that might be a little too much , but we ’ ll see how it goes .
i try not to think about it !
yes , i like it . i'm going to get it .
here's my john hancock .
let me use my credit card .
thank you for your help .
what a splendid idea !
can you tell me where the produce is ?
the pipe is in my bathroom .
what do you think of the test ?
can you describe their taste ?
how do i know if it's ripe ?
but they do .
hi jim . do you have a minute ?
some of us are going to start a soccer team . would you like to join us ?
no problem . let me have one .
yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much .
yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
yes , it's very lightweight . but i don't want this aluminum handle .
oh , these are great . i think i'll take this one .
i have to do some shopping .
i'm trying to buy a new bedroom set .
the water is causing mildew .
tell me what the street signs say .
i can ’ t right now .
didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus ?
are you sure that this bus will take us to santa anita mall ?
really , there's a bus stop right by the mall ?
really ?
now that i think of it , three days is better than seven .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
i got hungry and bought some chips .
did we get off the bus too early ?
that'll be fine .
i'm coming from fair oaks and las flores drive in altadena .
oh okay , thank you .
then what do i do ?
there's nothing else ?
hello , may i speak with the property manager , please ?
when are you going to go get it ?
how much does it cost for a bus pass ?
is there anything cheaper than that ?
how much is the monthly sticker ?
it doesn't cost anything ?
because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want .
i didn't even think about that .
how was it ?
would you like a drink ?
i need to get some beef .
i would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
excuse me , are you american ?
i had to carry my backpack with me all day .
how time flies . look , the president of the college has come onto the stage .
i'll do my best .
when will school start ?
is that yellow bus it ?
really ? that's great . you hope to join a company after graduating ?
what did you major in ?
did you get any rewards or honors in college ?
that's interesting . could you give any reasons for your choice ? can you explainwhy do you put medicine first ?
that ’ s true . i ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
you mean you got working experience , right ?
really !
then .
i really admire you , diana .
thank you for lending me the book .
how did you do in the last quiz ?
the principal just announced that dr . smith is going to take over as dean of our department .
ok , i'll try and put you through . please hold .
hello ?
we talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about .
i live in my uncle's house . he came here ten years ago .
david , what's new with you ? you are not in the mood . can you tell me ?
did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ?
excuse me . mr . li . may i ask you some questions ?
jenny , you look terrible . what's eating you ?
you can't do that , jenny !
you can't prove that by me . i saw the score on your report .
it's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies .
yeah . and i have 5 credits to spare . i only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but i took 15 because the price was the same .
he does that ?
that ’ s a little complicated . you ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people ’ s life . guess what ? even harvard university , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note harvard .
religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u . s .
what did you end up getting ?
i hate it and i was about to withdrawal . but after hearing your experience , i think i will tough it out .
why ? what's stressing you out ?
oh , really ? i just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . what about yours ?
i am a member of the basketball club . do you want to join us ?
i suggest you take this book . it's very exciting .
yes , i'd like to know how to use the library . you know , i'm a new student here .
how about tomorrow ?
sure . what are they ?
yes , but my notes are all nonsense . i can't figure out what is important .
when is it due ?
hello .
well , do you all major in the same subject ?
were i in your position , i ’ d go to america .
ok , i would like to check out these books .
hey eve , how are you ?
lucy , you ’ re back . how was your first day of school ?
really ? doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ?
is she your teacher ?
i'm going to register right now .
how much does it cost ?
yes . i started this part time job just three days ago . and my internship will last 1 week . i'm still a student now .
i passed history test .
it's popular you know . you want to reserve it ?
but i should have aced it . i mean i finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . but when i knew my result , i was like what ? that can't be true !
yes , it's a general name for several laws related to economics , like commercial law , and law of central bank .
oh , right ! do you have many exams at the end of each semester ?
why ? do you have to prepare for your examination ? oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important .
what do you think of the literature course .
could i see that , please ?
i don't think the teacher had a right to say that . the teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .
yes , i am applying on it .
aren't you a bit young ? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
when does it start ?
what time is the class ?
how much does it cost ?
yes , that's all right . i want to enroll in the course .
do you think this is a good idea ?
i think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it .
what may i do for you ?
follow me , please .
canada , china , and the use are huge too .
how may i help you ?
yes , i have seen those spots .
no , i have to do this ; it's important !
hello , i need to register for a class .
on what days are the classes ?
the meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . i think i need to read up about intercultural communication before i have another meeting with someone from another country .
what is it ?
it must be interesting to study english .
that's hilarious ! what did he say ?
is it true or isn ’ t it ?
hey , your chinese is coming along !
well , are you invested in some language exchange program ?
what are you majoring in ?
do you know anything about britain and america ?
no , i can't make it today .
i was sick .
when are we leaving for our field trip ?
of course ! let's go .
yes , right .
they're totally unreliable .
it wouldn't be full right now , would it ?
how may i help you ?
may i help you ?
can i do anything else for you ?
you have to take care of this video .
yes , i guess so .
actually , i did it , but then it got lost .
unfortunately , this is what i have to do .
i really need to learn this stuff .
no , i haven't seen those spots .
i'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester .
i have an issue with my schedule .
i am worried that i messed up on a test .
and that ’ s for each book that is late .
thank you for your payment .

we will fine you if you damage it .
is that all you would like to check out ?
i ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy .
may i help you ?
you need to pay ten cents for every copy .
you ’ re going to have to wait for a computer .
it ’ s right this way .
have you checked the periodicals section yet ?
it closes at six .
that's excellent ! have you received your conditional offers yet ?
what do you think about it ?
don't worry . if you don't do well , no one can !
have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ?
hi . ed , what's up ?
doesn't look like it to me .
woo , easy .
well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f
mary , don't move . stand right there . it's a good shot . the background is very pretty .
it must be very demanding .
do you have an online edition of that magazine ?
i didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . what ’ s the main storyline ?
oh yeah ! almost forgot ! i need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .
hello everyone , and welcome to our cpr for beginners course . first of all , does anyone know what cpr stands for ?
do you know where you want to transfer to ?
what is it ?
i ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in .
how could you manage to pass the exam ?
i hear little bob has recovered .
but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
has the train come yet ?
it ’ s so unreliable . i ’ ve been late for my meetings all this week .
our major is from a bigger city .
the cause is another boy .
no , seriously . i'm impressed .
what are you looking for now ?
what's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves .
tom , is jenny crying ?
it seems that nobody in your class likes paul .
i am so bored all day .
sure thing . i have an experience like that .
it's true . it was a bit loud .
do you have a cell phone ?
i think someone is stalking me .
you're looking great .
you forgot it last year as well .
i might just do that . what style of clothes do they have ?
i know . i'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting .
what happened to my cup ?
yes , and i like the color too . it matches your eyes .
what do you like best about her ?
what's up ? you look unhappy .
alice , i never knew you had such a lovely voice . you really can sing , can't you ?
no wonder you can control your voice so well . you are a professional singer .
i'm going to britain .
yes , i think so .
chill out ! what's eating you , anyway ?
i'm sorry man . i didn't know . i didn't mean to screw anything up .
thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you're a clothing expert .
why is it taking so long ?
i ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted .
so , why did you leave pcc ?
why didn ’ t you just stay at pcc ?
who was chairing the meeting ?
wow . she can be really nasty , can't she ?
hi , dave . this is zina .
so he talks about you behind your back ?
that was such a touching speech . he must have really known taylor well .
but he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . it's not like harry to do a thing like that .
my goodness ! what happened ? you have blood on your face .

you're absolutely right . i think the acting could be better .
he's tall and strong .
i can't wait to go skiing tomorrow .
the report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . the sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation .

the bridegroom looks a bit nervous .
hey jane . how are you doing these days ?
you're so lucky . i hope to get married to a guy like that .
actually , there's still another opening . if you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it .
about 80 million dollars .
so emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ?

here it is . but , what for ? we're already in .
jack , what are you doing ?
yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . you see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . what's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . as a teacher , you should be a little more sedate .
what are you doing tomorrow ?
yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good .
in taichung , i think .
that sounds pretty good . but isn't downloading music illegal ?
how did you first meet ?
that's too bad . what happened ?
yes , and the driver didn't speak any english or chinese and he didn't have a phone on him can you believe it ? and his radio didn't work . so there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi .
so kevin , what is your type ?

just so so . but we can travel twice every year .

your daughter looks like her mother .
i read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from shanghai to ningpo and dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the yangtze river have been reduced by 70 % .
if boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .

does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? it's hot in here .
well , i must be off now . i have an appointment at six .
i must catch the nine thirty train .
i'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
well , i need to change the shoes i bought from nasi . they are too small . i want to ask them whether they come in a larger size .
i see . overdoing it will do more harm than good .
you are full of boasts . i can examine you by question and answer . what is hollywood ? where is it ? what is the function of it ?
but i think he can't hold a candle to you . i don't think he has ever popped the question .
yes , their new album just came out last week . it is number one on the billboard .
but that'll affect the national economy .
then i must go you have said it yourself .
i have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now .
that is true . some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing .
why not ? i would like to buy some candies . since there are so many people , i think they must have delicious candy .

um . let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , i can never remember . 18 . 19 next birthday . tthat's it .
can you lend me fifty bucks ?
that's my business , not yours .
i wish i could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home .
what do you usually do with them ?
it's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much .
hello , friendship restaurant . may i help you ?
ten .
sure . the main courses are roast beijing duck and fried eel slices .
yes , sir . what time would you like your table , sir ?
why ?
well , then , may i invite you for the first dance ?
how nice it is here .
i'd better be going .
great ! it's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
i need your help , bob .
a / s / l , igp , h & k , and zzz . what the hell do they mean ?
not at all . i never really did , to be honest . what about you ? did your family used to play games together ?
in a few weeks . are you planning on watching them ?
they're also one of the richest couples . they have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want .
i'm dead serious . they've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore .
well , i guess you don't want this note , then .
that's too bad !
have a nice weekend !
t he nineteenth of june is my birthday . i'm planning to have a small party . could you come ?
well , you guys worked hard for it . it's really beautiful .
i don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . you have no problem with your hands .
it wasn't cold out this morning .
no . can i rent clubs ?
for the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground .
sure . first we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library .
you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . my friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
you are really a good citizen .
would you like to go to the concert with me ?
you didn't come to work yesterday . what happened ?
i would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could i about it anyway ?
tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . what's wrong with you ?
i'm sure and i remembered your phone number . i'll call you .
how will you spend this lovely weekend ?
how about 6:00 ?
i have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . one of my friends seems to be on good terms with sue .
is your helmet comfortable ?
are you ok ?
we are just going round the corner for a drink . won't you join us ?

welcome back ! how was your vacation ?
what is life ?
i see . moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you .
can you tell bob from tom ?
i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . recently , i've been obsessed with horror films .
yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them .
please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
the other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . how do you explain that ?
how about a movie on sunday , mum ?
you haven't spent much time with sophia lately . are you speaking to each other at the moment ?
maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you .
she's probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend .
well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner !
well , i've got to go . see you later .
let's keep in touch .
that's right . it'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
yeah , i'm going to the temple fair with my family .
he didn't buy it . his grandfather died recently and left him loads of money .
wow ! what a beautiful scenic spot ! it's so open . and just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
wonderful ! i'll often come here for mountain climbing .
how many people are there in your family ?
true . the movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . you see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . i generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . you can name a lot of classics from that decade .
it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . the house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . it's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . it's absolutely amazing !
no , that's just because i don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !
i like your sweater . it suits you very well .
how about having dinner with me ?
till the end of the week .
how about the second of march ?
thank you . i will if i have chance . goodbye and happy landing !
that ’ s very generous of you . i guess that would work .
well , i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and i'm going to end up getting stuck in rush hour traffic .
that sounds nice . where did you go ?
. i have a house in the suburbs .
i'm worried that she can't catch up with her class .
it's the powell orchestra .
they're doing a seventeenth century program .
perfect , and i like her charming eyes too .
i don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
i think only the family will be there .
of course . i have lots of best friends .
you must be lonely . i will share my friends with you .
why don't you look outside ?
i will chop your toes off , one by one .
hi , charles . what's the matter ?
hi , victor . how are you ?
that means it will get hotter .
what happened ?
did you call the repairman ?
really ? why ?
in a fast food restaurant .
i watched the movie forrest gump last night . and the question just lined in my mind .
no , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant .
the tv news is reporting a bank robbery .
diane grant ? i haven't seen you for ages !

i am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country .
has the chief accepted our plan ?
so there are only five working days in a week ?
i can't open the door .
let me ask the old woman in that reception office .
where should i sit ?
if you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well .
you want a bet ?
guess what ? paul and susan are engaged .
come on , mary . this is america . you make your own decisions here .
i said i like pop music very much . it ' s so lovely .
hey lucas , how was your trip to paris ?

don't worry . i'm not much of a dancer myself .
my pleasure . let's go and have a drink .
how dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
how did jim get the money ?
i couldn't agree more . actually , i'm a beijing opera fan .
i didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful .
ur , you really let me down .

long or short ? straight ? curly ?
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
but you like a girl to be rich , surely ?

ii can't agree more . the only child generation in china tends to know little about marriage .

he ’ s a bit tired , you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them , they could have all been killed .

i was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . i usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but i couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . how about you ?
that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well .
how would you do that ?
what ’ s your favourite ball sport ?
so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them .

management is going through a big turnover these days . with bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . they've been dropping like flies .
two tickets , please . how much are they ?
and the age gap is also annoying . there's a ten year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common .
do you somewhere often , laura ?
gambling ? where ?
i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just don ’ t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day .
oh , yes . i like to exercise . but i don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . i don ’ t have much time to do those things .
it was many years ago , when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night , and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when .
hey , what's new ?
since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful .

it said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier .
so it is hard to be a black student on campus ?
no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .

you are so lucky .
anytime . you can reach me at 5558929 .

why not ? we're supposed to meet him there .
that ’ s just it ! i don ’ t know what to get her ! last year i got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! i suck at getting presents for people .
that ’ s just it , i ’ m not happy anymore , tim . it ’ s not you , it ’ s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guythat any woman would kill for !
i don't know . i'm pretty full . what are we having ?
it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ?

are you interested in history ?
now that it ’ s the new year , i ’ ve decided to turn over a new leaf .
and stay in the shallow area . i don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier .
thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! i ’ ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! let ’ s get started !
i'm catching the eleven o'clock train .

aw , come on , it was nothing . i'm just doing my job .
that ’ s it , my lease is up . i have to move .

bye , mom !
it would be nice to get out of the city . do you want some company ?
i am not wrong ! the chicken came first !
that ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the face off . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
what's bothering that guy ?
did you understand question number three ?
i'm not comfortable about this , sandy . i don't understand most of these games .
this one is 2300 dollars . maybe i should buy it for my mother . what do you think ?
maybe i could buy some cognac for my brother . he always drinks it .
no , fireworks are awesome !
that ’ s all you ever think about , food ! oh , i think the bride ’ s coming now ! she looks gorgeous . wait , what ’ s she doing ? where ’ s she going ?

i heard you were teaching english over there . tell me about it . did you like it ?
the hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay .
well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don ’ t go together .
and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control .
hello , jim . what was the film like ?
hi , kenny . let's go for a drink .
i don't feel like drinking tonight . i'm gonna hang out at yy's .
we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
we've got a few . i can teach you how to surf on sunday . it'll be fun !
you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . my friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
have you ever been to disneyworld ?
thanks for the advice . i'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
that's true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .
i don't want to argue with you anymore . this is going to be tough , but let ’ s try and be friends .
yes . they used to be joined at the hip .
yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things .
i see what you mean . i think that's way i like it so much .
i sure hope so . we've each invited about 10 people .
one glass of red wine coming up !
yeah , me , too . it's about time i made a move .
i don't know . i've got mixed feelings about it . on the one hand , i really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , i don't want to be without him .
sure , would you like to see them ?
do you need a hand ?
true , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ?
thanks for coming , it was a real blessed .
ok , then count me in . where will we stay ?
what's wrong , jerry ? you look so upset .
never mind that , i'll take care of it . are you available next week ?
ok . i'm going to have to skip over this section . it's girl talk .
oh . it's actually all rather personal .
i didn't really have to figure it out . i just followed the instructions !
do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the new year's party had yo yos ?
i went straight to university afterwards . what about you ?
hello . where are you headed today ?
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
then let's go in .
what's he trying to pull anyway .
hi , betty !
i have a small family . they are my parents , my younger brother and me .
well , then , may i invite you for the next dance ?
in college . but i don't dance very often . what's your favourite dance ?
oh , thank you . i'm going to the library , are you coming ?
nice to meet you too .
that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ?
oh , it's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
that sounds good .
the taj ? they're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
what kind of services do they offer ?
did your wife enjoy it ?
i hate to say goodbye , but it's late .
yeah , that's right . if no one sends me test messages , i'll go crazy .
do they have any children ?
i'm sorry to hear that . what kind of movie do you like ?
yes , we have a big tree this year . i bought the decorations at the five and tencent store yesterday . do you want to come and see it ?
are you going swimming again this afternoon ?
and my wife would be happy if i bought her a mink coat .
what are you going to do after you return from washington ?
what are you going to do ?
he's a bit tired . you know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning . he doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . it often takes him a couple of hours to finish
you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .
oh , what is it ?
why ? i think cats are ok .
i find it really hard to express myself in class . i have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
you ’ re right . by the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ?
do many people like tennis ?
is the environment a big issues in your country ? it is in mine .
