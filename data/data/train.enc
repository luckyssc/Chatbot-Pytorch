i need something to wash this down . is there any juice in the fridge ?
it's a green drink . it's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
the sales lady said that even if i eat right , i wouldn't get enough vitamins .
it's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast .
you won't make it through the day without breakfast .
breakfast is brain food . maybe that's why your grades are suffering .
don't ' uh , dad ' me . sit down and have some lovely breakfast .

you can take one tonic or hand cream .
no problem . you can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it .
that's good .

you're right . well , just these two , please .
i can't believe the way our landlord cheated us .
yes , sir ?

can you shorten this pipe for me ? it's too long .
mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ?
i'm really interested . tell me about them .
that's cool . i bet you could bring your own food .
why don't we do that anymore ?
do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?
does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed .
i think that's just steam . your engine's overheated .
a little bit . i'll take a look if you want me to .
yeah , she's hot . radiator's leaking . looks like you were running her pretty hard .
did you have an accident recently . hey , wait a second ! i know this car !
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name's hal .
boy , i'm sure sorry about your car . hey , akimbo , i wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
i'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
i'd rather not . they'll raise my rates . it'll cost me more in the long run .
hell , i don't care . just don't submit a report to your insurancecompany .
who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?
didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?
i'm going crazy .
i've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
is there anything i can do for you ?
did you have anything particular in mind ?
well , we have some handmade products . let me show you some .

this is the house i want to rent .
no problem . first , it's comfortable and cozy . second , it has a lovely view of the city . third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .
200 dollars per week .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth , the room is so large that i can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
don't you think i can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where i work ?
chinese tea is famous all over the world . i want to buy several boxes .
well , i do not know chinese tea at all .
sounds interesting . what about this ?
what's this ? it smells fragrant .
i will take the jasmine tea . could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? it is a gift for my friend .
can i help you ?
the moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . that's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony .
all the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , cantonese style and suzhou style .

why is there water all over the bathroom floor ?
excuse me , i have something to trouble you .

all right . thank you .
oh , yes , it is . i'll take this one .
ann , it's terrible !
look , this is a pimple !

i have no bad habit . i sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . i have done a lot .
i wasn't aware of that !
hello ? can you give me a tow ? my tour car's stranded .

tommy played truant today . his teacher called me this morning .
i've asked him , but he won't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .
stop , stop . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
in that way , i'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
what is this big box at the front door ?
what did you get yourself into ?
so , what's in the box ? a fridge ?
i guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you !
what's up ? you sound a little down in dumps .
calm down ! shouting won ’ t help ?
what happened ?
what ? he can't do this to you .
hold it , mike . you won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
i know . it wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate .
how can i help you ?
do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes .
personally , i quite like the new perfume from clinique . it's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ?
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
i know what she would like some whitening cream .
will that be all then ?
good morning , madam . can i help you ?
how do you prefer this one ? it cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . the gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy .
we've also got a fragrance free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . i'm sure you'll like it .
yes , sure . this line of products is fragrance free . we have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic .
what did you buy at the market ?
you seem to have bought the whole market !
paper cuts are all hand made . let me see the paper cuts you bought . they are all animals .
all right . animals , especially chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper cuts . but there are other themes .
why do you want to buy so much ?
are there pets allowed in this apartment ?
if i had one , could i rent this apartment ?
what about a gila monster ?
dad , can i have a pet ? i did what you said and passed all of my exams .
i want a dog . my friend mindy's dog just had puppies and she said i can have one .
i know , i know . i will do it all by myself .
yes . it will cost me about $ 50 a month . and i make a little more than that already .
beth , would you like me to help you carry it ?
i think this painting would look good in our living room . what do you think ?
help ! i'm about to drop these books .
what can i do for you ?
i'd like to . how do you like the hat ?
how about the umbrella ? it's made of wood and paper . it's very beautiful .
do you like it ?
fifty yuan .
where are you going , tony ?
mom said you couldn't go out .
has someone already helped you ?
which do you like best ?
360 yuan .
sorry , sir . this is the last one we have in stock .
i can give you a 10 % discount .
i'm afraid that's the best we can do .
finish your hot chocolate and we will go .
no , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria .
let's go then . on the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction .
can you see a post office somewhere around here ?
oh , no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
money is no object .
i will take ten .
of course . can i have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
what can i do for you ?
all right . this way , please .
yes , sir .
yes , they are all distinctive chinese .
how do you like this one ? it's very beautiful .
350 yuan .
dad , do you know where mom is ?
she'd better not start crying like she usually does .
dad , now don't you go getting mush on me .
that means a lot to me dad . thanks .
mom , look ! my first piggy bank and it still has money in it !
thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom .
i think i'm going to keep it as a monument to what i've learned about money .
i know . i miss him terribly .
i thought i would feel like i was in the lap of luxury .
no , i think i will run things much the same way that dad did .
do i have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ?
thank you . i'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . is there anything that you can recommend for me ?
no more than three .
how about its quality ?
we will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . let's go to supermarket to buy some food .
what should we buy ?
it is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top .
that's enough for the kids . get some drinks .
right . we should buy some yoghurt for kids .
ok . four saucers . we can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning .
can i help you ?
what kind of stamps do you want ?
i must weigh it .
registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all .
hi barbara . have you lost weight ?
wow . you look great .
what type of diet were you on ?
that doesn't make sense . if you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?
that makes sense . i'm going to try that .
i have a little gut i have been trying to get rid of .
nancy , please turn the tv down .
i'm sleepy . i can hardly keep my eyes open .
nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . do you know why ?
he really misses his friends from our old neighborhood .
how do you propose to help him understand that ?
i guess we could go visit once in a while too .
oops !
i overcooked the corn .
i'm freezing . turn down the air conditioner , will you ?
hi , i'm home ! can you double that recipe ? i ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner .
i don't think so . do you remember bob gain from tulsa ?
he was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day .
you're glad he saved me , huh ?
can you believe her ? she is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet .
me too . but what are we going to do ? i have been on 4 different diets and i can't seem to lose weight .
what do you know ? you are over weight too .
i know . but i don't have someone to diet with . if we help each other and motivate each other , then i think we can lose some weight .
c'mon . you'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there .
it's a great idea . i can't believe i didn't think of this earlier . going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed .
great . i'll get our plan started right away .
how much are the pears ?
give me one kilo of those , please . do you have any fresh plums ?
it's a bit too expensive . we can get it for six yuan in the shop next here .
sounds reasonable . i'll take three kilos .
i'm sorry to interrupt you . please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . if you don't want it , please replace it .
oh , it's out of stock at the moment . why don't you choose another brand instead ?
you can have a try . maybe you will like it .
good afternoon , sir . gan i help you ?
which brand are you interested in ?
do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ?
how about flymo ? it's selling well .

my mom and dad insist that i be home before ten . do you have a curfew ?
i wish my parents were a little more lenient .
you like going to bed early ?
well , i still hate having a curfew .
i found a great school for junior !
we can't be too cautious about these things .
there is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook !
there is a library right inside the front door .
i just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat .
i think she is really going to like her teacher though .
did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ?
tom , it's time for you to take a shower .
why ? you can't be always so lazy .
alright . but you promise this is the last time .
mom , will you tuck me in tonight ?
i hope i don't have any nightmares tonight .

good morning . what can i do for you , sir ?
very well . please sit down here . do you want me to cut your hair very close ?
it's such a hot season , isn't it ? may i suggest thinning out the top ?
( several minutes later ) now it's done . is it satisfactory ?
anything else i can do for you , sir ?
hi ! do you know what's for dinner ? i'm starving !
out ? what do you mean out ?
dad and mom ?
you mean this is going to be a regular thing ?
shall we go to the library by subway ?
ok . there is no subway in my city .
where do we pay the fare ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
excuse me , do you sell apples ?
do you sell them individually or by weight ?
could you weigh these , please ?
a sack of cherries , please .
may i help you ?
how about this one ? it smells like green tea and is our best seller . try it .
it goes for $ 40 .
i would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot .
yes . it's a traditional dish .
you are right , sir . to prepare it , a sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . that's why the dish has a bright colour .
what kind of cuisine do you have ?
hangzhou food .
all right . i'll take it .
yes , i like using chopsticks .
yes , but i don't know what soup you have .
good . i prefer beef soup .
taxi .
i am going to the railway station .
thank you . can we get there in half an hour ?
my train will leave at 3:00 , i'll have to arrive there before 2:50 .
can't we go faster ?
can you show me how to use chopsticks ?
oh , it is not easy to learn !
well , i don't think i can manage with it .
may i help you ?
yes , madam . what sort of gloves do you want ?
certainly . what size do you take ?
i think a six is your size . how do you like these ? i can recommend them , they're very reliable .
how would you like your eggs ?
and your toast , light or dark ?
will there be anything else ?
one hard boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow .
may i have a reservation ?
i've got three guests today . we'd like a table next to the window .
i'm chen liang .
we may come at 6:30 p . m .
what are you doing ?
are there any good programs on tv ?
which channel is it ?
i think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls .
hmm maybe you're right . but i can't stand all this green carpet here . and besides , i know how to paint . i will just cover everything with drop cloth . i won't get anything on the floor .
yes , i'm sure i've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful .
absolutely not . we can remove the carpet ourselves . carpet is held down with carpet nails . you just need to pull it hard and it will come up .
yes . but we should hire someone for that . that will probably be expensive . and it has to be done right .
yes . i'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . can you arrange it for us ?
let me see . it seems a little late .
ok . i'll change the time to 8: 00 .
it's john .
we also have a cat and a dog .
no . my father takes the dog for a walk every monday , tuesday and sunday .
who takes the dog on saturday ?
do you help with the housework ?
you're right . watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . i like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast .
have you ever heard of a movie rental company called netflix ? they send the movies directly to your house in the mail .
good evening , saliva . what's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? what are you doing now ?
are you good at cooking ?
it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? !
yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well done and too salty .
i have the same idea as yours .
thank you . oh , it's very delicious .
besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ?
thanks a lot .
alright , tell me what you think about this one .
yeah , maybe you're right . how about this outfit ?
no , i don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just want to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it's casual , yet sophisticated .
how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?
that's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
that would be very kind of you . by the way , is it a monthly magazine ?
boy , come here !
bring me a cup of coffee , please .
won't you have some of this ?
it's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .
i use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
i'm glad you like it .
oh , but chinese food is so delicious . i wish i knew how to cook chinese food . do you follow recipes ?
here , let me get the door for you .
do you need a hand with that ?
doctor , my child is nine years old , and i recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school .
he is doing ok , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies .
this may be complicated . but i think he may need to build up his self esteem .
nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
there are many new kinds of newspapers . i find it hard to choose among them . which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ?
what's the reason that people prefer to read this one ?
good morning , mrs . smith .
what kind of books does she like ?
jim ? jim ? . what are you doing in the kitchen ?
milk ? i thought you didn't like milk .
nonsense . there's lots of food in the refrigerator . what's behind your back ?
what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see .
ok , i promise . what is it ?
oh , jim . i told you . no pets . it'll make a mess of this house .
no way . it might belong to somebody else . you can't keep it here .
all right . but you have to clean up everything it messes up .
there are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . but only a few of them are influential world wide .
but i think digest is supposed to be the top one . its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . it's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it .
hello , do you have any vacancies ?
what kind of apartment is it ?
i don't like feature films . i think sometimes it loses contact with reality . i like to see some documentary films . what kind of feature films do you like best ?
hello ?
sorry , i think you have the wrong number .
yes . who are you looking for again ?
oh , i thought you said laura . sorry about that . this is the right number , but heather's not here right now .
she went to the store to buy some groceries . would you like to leave a message ?
hi eric , this is her roommate kathy . i met you a couple months ago at the christmas party .
good . heather will be back in about 20 minutes . i'll tell her you called .
i saw your ad in the new york times . i am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .
the two bedroom apartment on 38th east street .
that's why i think it may suit my needs .
the ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . is it true ?
will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month by month basis ?
how much is the rent ?
and how much is the deposit ?
mmm . it is delicious .
in fact , could i ask you for the recipe ?
yes , i've got it .
wait a minute . i didn't catch you there . could you repeat that ?
hello , who's that speaking ?
yes , i do .
yes , it's fully furnished .
it's in international trade zone . it's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station .
the price can be talked over . how about coming around and taking a look at it first ?
hey sarah , i'm having some trouble finding an apartment . can you help me look at some listings online ?
well , it has to be cheap . i don't want a really expensive apartment .
jeff , look at this listing ! it says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . what do you think ?
hmm . let me look . yes , it says it's a pet friendly building .
well , this apartment is really a must see . will you come with me to look at it this weekend ?
great ! do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ?
it's located in the suburbs ? well even though that sounds like a steal , i really want something downtown .
well , what about this two bedroom apartment ? the listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro .
it says it's $ 1600 . but if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month .
i'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to the downtown , as i spend most of my time at the office .
i'm sure it is wonderful , but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
good evening , yanking restaurant .
certainly , sir . for how many people , please ?
of course . may i have your name , please ?
a friend told me i might find a room here .
what do you charge ?
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?
i'd like to reserve a table for three this evening .
do you have pot service at noon ?
ok , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow .
black .
can you show me some jade , please ?
no , but i do like jade bracelets .
thank you . ( a moment later ) oh , this one is quite impressive . i'll take it . by the way , do you sell pearl earrings ?
do you take in students ? i've been told you might have a vacant room .
could i have a look at it , please ?
thank you .
i'm sure he could , but i prefer not to bother him . would my bank do ?
when can i see the one bedroom apartment ?
how much is it ?
ok . can i see the room now ?
mmmm . this apartment seems a little expensive . do you have any cheap studios ?
do you think any studios will open up soon ?
can i have a month to month lease ? i only want to rent the apartment for five months .
well , then i don't think this would be a good apartment for me . thank you anyway .
are utilities included in the rent ?
do i have to pay for electricity myself ?
excuse me , how do i get to the grand hotel ?
what games do you like ?
what about guessing games ?
let's play other game .
excuse me , you look lost . can i help you ?
right . let me see . you go straight down here and turn right .
then take the next left then the next right . are you with me ?
miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ?
this is a new product of company this year . it's oil free .
it gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
do you keep the receipt ?
what do you want me to do about it ?
this way , please . we've got a nice private for you .
here we are . i hope you will like it .
and here is the menu . i'll come back soon .
do you play cards ?
what's the english for hongtao , leitao , meihua and fangpian ?
i'm sorry , sir . the rooms are not available now . but would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall ? i can find a table by the window for you .
can i have your name , please ?
i'll ask waitress to show you the way .
hey , ann . you don't have a pen , do you ?
thanks . i don't suppose you have some paper , too .
so click here , then up to the top .
then open that window . yeah , that one .
and that's it . you're done .
sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ?
yes , and they have a sale on now .
i prefer something like this one a touring bike , but it is more expensive .
the price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount .
i'd like to taste some local dishes . what would you recommend ?
could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
is it good ?
i think i'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
what kind do you have ?
i'd like to buy a house about 300m with a garden . can you help me ?
where is it ?
how many rooms are there ?
how much is it ?
ok . how much is the deposit ?
hi sam .
when did you buy your new computer ?
can i have a look ?
oh this is the new little eee notebook from asks . how much did you pay ?
very nice . i am sure we will sort out your internet in no time .
are you ready to order now , sir ?
would you like an appetizer ?
would you like some soup first ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
have you decided on anything ?
how about stewed fried steamed pork ?
are you interested in today's special ?
twice cooked spicy pork slices .
anything else ?
the car isn't running smoothly . i'd like to have a look at it .
i'm not sure . it could be the tires . let's stop here .
excuse me , do you know where the post office is ?
is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ?
ok . do i turn on the lights or do i go straight ?
and do i take that road ?
is there a post office sign on the building ?
thank you very much .
playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ?
i'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . i noticed that most chess players were bald .
may i take your order now ?
certainly . i would recommend ' songshuguiyu ' .
well , it is sweet and sour fried mandarin fish .
then , how about this one ?
very good . could i serve you anything else ?
my pleasure . just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . please enjoy your lunch .
let's see . i had the salmon starter which was £ 5 . 90 and my pizza was £ 8 . 25 .
so that's £ 14 . 15 for me and £ 16 . 50 for you .
yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us .
and i had a dessert that's another £ 3 . 50 . and you had coffee which is £ 2 .
yes , this is everything on the list .
yes , that's exactly it . how much tip shall we give the waiter ?
good evening .
let me check the list . yes , we do have a reservation under mr . tim .
it doesn't matter . follow me , please . what do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?
i'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats .
thank you for your understanding , mr . tim .
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
i know , dear . i am too . but we've just been too busy to look for a house .
not necessary . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
yes , that's often true . but you have to pay them .
of course we need a house inspector . but we can hire an inspector on our own . as for the legal problems , i have friends . they can help us .
it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time . that's why we haven't done it yet . it's very troublesome .
where to , madam ?
i think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam .
thank you . how much is the fare ?
here you are . keep the change .
good evening , sir . welcome to our restaurant .
do you have a reservation ?
may i have your name , please ?
mr . brown . we were expecting you . this way , please . will this table be fine ?
please take a seat .
would you like to have a piece of cake ?
why ? you're not fat .
women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self confident .
well . there's a beauty contest in thailand just for fat beauties .
all the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg .
excuse me . could you tell me the way to the star hotel ?
how long will it take me to get there ?
thank you very much .
where to , sir .
star hotel . ok .
about 20 minutes .
how much is the fare ?
good morning , madam . i think i'm lost here . the place i want to go to is a hotel called the hilton .
no , i am sorry i have no idea . i am a stranger here .
oh , yes . my friend told me the hotel was near the central railway station .
can you show me where the central railway station is on this map ?
hello , are you interested in this honda ?
1999 .
6 , 000 miles , all highway mileage .
highway miles are not as bad as local miles . they do not hurt car as much .
the owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line .
one month .
you'll check it out anyway you want . you can take it to a garage .
leave your phone number , and i will give you a call if the price gets reduced .
what else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ?
i'm the painter . you can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . that will probably be pretty expensive too . having good curtains made isn't cheap .
absolutely not . the windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . so that will take a while . maybe a month or so .
me ? cook our dinners ? hah ! you will be cooking , dear . you will cook .
well , i suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . so you won't be able to afford any clothes next year .
maybe i'll cook once or twice a week . how is that ?
hi , mike . i am going to move on the first of next month .
yes , i am trying to find good movers now . do you know any ?
what did you do for your last move ?
oh . that's very nice of him .
miss , may i help you ?
sure . please take a look at the model of the building . nice garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled block i and block ii . block i has a total of thirty eighth floors . the thirty seventh and thirty eighth are penthouses . there are four units in one floor . the sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . the size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .
there are three elevators between one hundred and forty eight units .
there are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents .
sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . there are two swimming pools . one is olympic standard size and the other one is for children . also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only .
the completion date will be july 1st 2007 .
please check up the price list . the average unit price is five million hong kong dollars . there are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers .
it's all written on the brochure price list . i believe there will be one right for you . please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone .
you know , i'm a pretty laid back person . i don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . for example , i like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal .
yeah , i really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . it's important that we don't get on each other's nerves .
excuse me , could you tell me which bus i should take to go to the railway station ?
how often dose this bus go there ?
i really can't wait that long . are there any other buses that can take me there ?
where can i find the bus ?
certainly , madam . what kind of coffee would you like ?
well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and americano .
hi steve , it's nice to meet you . i hear that you're looking for an apartment , and i just rented a two bedroom downtown . i'm looking for a compatible roommate .
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .
i agree . i heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . is that true ?
no , we don't , especially the elder people . but more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays .
yes .
yes , i've got some coins . how much is the fare ?
i see . how often does this bus run at this time of day ?
may i know where you are going ?
i'm sorry . you are going in the wrong direction .
don't worry . you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . the bus stop is right there .
here we are on the train .
i hear many people have cars .
why don't they drive ? isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?
good coming , sir .
would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ?
where are you going ?
don't worry . i'll let you know when we get there .
could you tell me how to use it ?
thank you for your help .
may i try on this pair of shoes ?
i think it's 35 .
hmm , i don't feel very comfortable .
can i see some men's watches ?
what functions does this watch have ?
is it waterproof ?
ok , it will be a new experience for me .
where do we pay the fare ?
do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ?
may i help you , sir ?
what color do you want ?
what size are you ?
no problem . i think 40 will be fine for you .
would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
no , the one next to it .
thanks . what kind of stone is this ?
yes , please . how much is it ?
let's have a look at the map first .
let's buy some tickets .
well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
what would you have ?
what about this dry red ? it's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
here it is .
may i recommend you tsingtao beer ?
yes . the beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the lao mountain .
fine , sir .
tin or bottle ?
would you like it on the rocks , sir ?
welcome !
with ice , sir ?
anything else , sir ?
fruit juice , milk or mineral water ?
i'd like to reserve a table for two , please .
around 8: 30 p . m .
yes , anthony fox .
are you ready to order now , sir ?
how would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well done ?
would you like something to drink ?
two number 3s , please .
diet coke .
no , thanks .
waitress , can i have the bill , please ?
do you accept credit cards ?
good afternoon , sir . can i help you ?
what flavor would you prefer , sir ?
anything else , sir ?
i like the honda accord you showed me before . i think it's more practical for my needs .
cruise control ? i don't like that .
i suppose . and what about the sunroof ? is that standard ?
for me , now an important question to buy an accord is the time when i can get this car . i need a new car rather soon .
that's good enough , i think . what colors does the new accord come in ?
my brother has last year's accord . and his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . i really like that color . i wonder if i can get that color on my accord .
yes , i think that's it . can i get that on the accord ?
well , i think i want to order the new accord then . it looks like an excellent car .
that's great ! what comes along with moutan ?
it sounds good .
really ? let me have a try .
hello , how are you ? i am jack .
what brings you here ?
yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1 , 000 discount . i've never seen a sale as good as this one .
sure . it has 1 . 8 liter engine . this one comes with all power options , air condition , cd player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and abc . the window price is $ 17 , 000 , and i can give you for $ 16 . 000 .
you must be kidding ! you cannot get that price anywhere .
can you put down a $ 2 , 000 deposit , and i'll talk to my manager , see what we can do .
okay , i'll be right back . congratulations ! the manager approved the final price $ 15 , 000 .
you are really tough . you got a deal .
hi ! do you want a fill up ?
which type of gas do you want ? regular , super , or premium unleaded ?
regular is $ 1 . 15 , super is $ 1 . 25 and premium is $ 1 . 39 .
we'd like some local flavored pastry . can you recommend some ?
what is that ?
that sounds appealing . ok , we will have that .
ok . we will try some .
no , it's enough .
may i take your order ?
i'm afraid this course is for four persons .
i'm afraid not , sir .
i would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes .
would you like rice with your meal ?
are you ready to order now , sir ?
would you like an appetizer ?
would you like some soup first ?
what kind of soup would you like ?
have you decided on anything ?
how about stewed fried steamed pork ?
are you interested in today's special ?
twice cooked spicy pork slices .
anything else ?
would you show us the menu ?
i'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , i'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards .
well , i'll have a glass of mineral water .
no , thank you . i think it's enough for dinner .
is there a car park near the supermarket ?
hello , can i help you ?
how long has it been on for ?
you can still drive , without problems .
let's check it out . there'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . if you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair .
please write down your address and phone number , and sign here .
it'll be about an hour . are you going to wait ?
can i help you ?
what's wrong with them ?

what kind of car is it ?
write down your name and address , give me the key , and i will check it out .
no .
about half an hour .
may i have your order , please ?
ok . how do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ?
anything else ?
do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
you have the point . i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals i think it's also tastier than normal rice . yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
i know . but why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ?
do you have hypertension ? i would have thought you were too young .
well , i'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet .
fine .
the special today is steak .
what would you like to go with your steak ?
i see . what would you like for dessert ?
i believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .
healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . so we are free to have whatever foods we love . it is unbelievable .
seriously ?
maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .
i think i need some iced water , too . is there an extra charge for that ?
that's fine . could you give me some more napkins , too ?
do i owe you for the sauce , pepper and napkins ?
can i take your order ?
what kind of drink do you want with those meals ?
how about anything for dessert , like an apple pie or ice cream ?
may i help you ?

what do you recommend ? we'd like some of your local specialities .

good evening , mr . frank . bourbon on the rocks ?
what about mao tai , one of the most famous liquors in china ? it's good indeed . it never goes to the head .

what's the chef's specialty ?
bring me one and besides , i would like to have a chicken cream soup .

wow , what a cool car ! the styling of this car really appeals to me .
you can tell me here . i just want to know the price .
i appreciate your help , but i think i'll look around a bit .

yes .
yes . it's an excellent system .
yes , it's a macintosh . it's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing .
i'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .

that's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and word processing , and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you're from ?
well , i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america , especially in universities and publishing companies , apple is very commonly used .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
no , don't be sorry . it's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me , most of the students here in the university asian students included most of them use apple .

i saw on tv that there is an entertainment item , bungee in beijing longtanhu park . except that the height is not exiting enough .
the highest bungee spot in the world is located in mount kikicama , south africa , which is 216 meters high . a cable car in a scenic spot in switzerland is 160 meters high .
it is said that bungee was originally a grown up ceremony of the indigenous people of new guinea . people stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . when they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently .

we'll have to get you to a hospital for an x ray .
it may be worse than it seems . how's it feel ?
of course ! it's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . will we have to wait much longer ?
in 1986 , a new zealander hackett popularized bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . this sport is very challenging . it is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . the timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . no wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
wow ! what a beautiful scenic spot . it's so open . and just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .

ping pong must be the top ranking popular sport in china . it seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles .

is this where i can catch a bus to the theater ?
morning , tom ! what are you doing over there ? learning to dance ?
oh , my goodness . i'm sorry . but i don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that .
well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you .
to begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time .
good ! and then , the entire body . never incline your body forward or backward . take care to regulate the point of balance . place it at your waist .
no ! you should avoid sticking out your belly . keep your hip steady . don't swing .
excuse me , i'm looking for the holiday inn . do you know where it is ?
is it far from here ?

now that you have learned kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ?
you mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? to some extent your idea holds water . kung fu was originally intended for self defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . now we are apt to treat it as an art .
thanks for your compliment ! perhaps the chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . do you know jin yong ?
all of his works have been translated into english . i recommend you to read one or two works of his . you'll get a general glimpse into chinese kung fu culture . when you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life .
yes , take philosophy , for instance . what makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? it's not enough only to be formidable . it also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life .

the facial will start with a thorough cleansing .
yes . we'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun .
what was that ?
if it's not too much trouble , i would like some help .
is there any cable for the internet ?
how much do i need to pay for it ?
is there a mailbox in the apartment ?
are there any parking lots for the tenants ?
is there an alarm system in the apartment ?
are smoke detectors provided ?
hi , i ’ m cindy , the office clerk . what can i do for you ?
hi henry . how are you ? is everything okay in your apartment ?
yes , please .
yes , it ’ s l8v 4b7 .
i ’ ll tell peter to bring your key to your apartment right away .
no problem . go ahead , please .
we are at 2368 king street east .
so , it ’ s easy to get to the office from here . from your apartment , just drive along king street east for about one kilometer and you ’ ll see a three story blue building on your right . that ’ s the department of motor vehicles building where you can change your driver ’ s license .
it ’ s on the first floor .
come on in . let me show you around . here ’ s the living room .
this is the kitchen .
yes . we just renovated a few month ago .
here ’ s the master bedroom .
$ 900 a month .
yes . it includes electricity , water , gas and cable , but the telephone is extra .
the end of this month .
sure .
you see , there is a run at the neck .
i want to lose some weight !
i have a yoga class tomorrow . do you want to come with me ?
what are you going to do ?
you are in the pink recently . how do you make it ?
are you tired after class ?
what did you say ?
well , i feel a little tired .
it won't be long . no more than ten minutes . why don't you go ahead and i'll meet you in the park ?
hi , i ’ m ray , your tenant in room 209 .
there ’ re some problems in my apartment . first , the faucet in the bathtub drips constantly .
one of the burners on the stove doesn ’ t work .
i can ’ t control the temperature .
well , there ’ s one more thing . the telephone is dead .
( at the met station ) hurry up ! we are running late for school .
which line should we take if we go to danshui ?
how much money should i insert in the slot ?
i see .
it's a priority seat . we can not sit there . we should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people .
if we go to danshui in the morning on a weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour .
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
how ’ s that ?
check your petrol situation .
that ’ s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway .
remember , no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies !
hello , do you remember me ? i bought some vases from you yesterday .
that's right . i thought i'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs .
well , first , i'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that , too .
how much do they cost ?
yes , i think i'd like the green mask in the middle .
yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
hello , can i help you ?
this dress is the latest fashion form paris . it ’ s made of pure silk . and this silk blouse would go with this skirt . do you like it ?

hello , frank .
not too much . i'm looking to rent an apartment .
no . he likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
yes . but he doesn't care . i really wouldn't want to move , but i simply can ’ t stand him .
so , how should we get to the theatre ?
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
it wasn't just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
we're already late , so i think we had better take a taxi .

have you been served , sir ?
good afternoon , anything i can do for you ?
well , we have some nice sugar .
oh , dear . my weight has gone up again .
and i suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help .
i've tried diets before but they've never worked .
do you know the address ?
can you write it down for me please ?
is it faster if i take highland avenue ?
hello . i want to send the computer to my sister in shanghai by logistics transport .
yes . this is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
there are a mouse and a camera .
i see . can you weigh them for me , please ?
what can i do for you , sir ?
do you want to have a tub bath , surfing bath or shower ?
all right . the fitting room is over there .

hum can you recommend me one with high interest ?
i want the one with the highest interest rate .
all right . i'ii open this one .

i'm really sorry , but i seem to have misplaced your towel .
i'm very sorry . can i get you another one ?

$ 50 .
about 2 years .

please excuse me for what i said just now . what do you think of this one ?
sorry . it is the smallest size we have .
oh , yes . there is a big one at the right corner of the street . perhaps you will get one there .
hello , ma ’ am . can i help you ?
how about this one ? i think it looks terrific on you .
sure . the fitting room is on your right .
you look pretty in red .
$ 29 . 99 .
excuse me . where are the rice and flour ?
yesterday i had a quarrel with my roommate . i'm really fed up with all this .
good afternoon . can i be of any assistance to you ?
here are the suits . which one would you like ?

thanks .
excuse me . how much is the chocolate bar ?
so , i can have five for five dollars ?
oh , yeah . i forgot tax . give me four then , please .
honey , i think you should quit smoking .
but i want you to be fit .
check out this article . it says smoking can lead to lung cancer .
but you know that smoking does harm to health , right ?
stop beating around the bush . will you quit or not ?
have you been taken care of ?
is there any special brand you'd like ?
the franchised store is on the second floor .
excuse me . are these chips on sale ?
is there any limit ?
that ’ s good . thanks .
i'm so hungry ! i haven't late eaten all day !
they're all so thin ! her cheekbones are great .
the mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . if only we could be that thin then .
oh , bathroom blues .
i went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small .
( weigh herself ) hey , i lost a kilo in a week with my all fruit diet . if i keep going , i can wear that dress next month .

just a little steak , uh . snack ? a bowl of clam chowder ?
you're right . but if i get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again .
you know . soup , well , society makes us like this .
well , thin is always in with the media .
if you aren't thin , you're nobody .
you lost me .
may i help you ?
this way , please . how do you like this one ? it's made of cotton .
have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
i don't really know . why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . he can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
i am looking for a blouse . can you show me the way , please ?
i have no idea . could you recommend me one ?
we have a variety of trousers . which one do you like best ?
what about this one ?
have you a garment ?

what can i do for you ?
what about jeans ? it's the fashion now .
then , how about this ?
did you smell something ? it smells so great .
how come i never knew that ? do they have a new baker or something ?
let's go and get some cookies . i am hungry now .
it's one of my favorite bakeries .
can your dog do any tricks ?
so who takes care of him then ?
i can't do that with my cat . she hates water .
your dog is really cute . what's his name ?
what kind of dog is he ?
well , he sure likes to run around a lot . is he well behaved ?
that sounds like my cat . she likes to scratch the couch with her claws .

$ 15 .
well , madam , the meter was not on at all . you didn't tell me .
excuse me , driver . let me off here , please .
i have just changed my plan .
excuse me , ma ' am . i would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to london . it is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days .
that's fine with me . i am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time .
i see . how much do i need to pay in total for this package ?
can i have the receipt ? just in case i can trace it if something goes wrong .
do i need to include my zip code in the address ?
thank you very much . here is 500 dollars .
thank god , it's friday ! time for a drink ! let's hit the bars !
should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ?
port's too sweet . it's a dessert wine . a dry red french wine would be nice with meat . a glass of chilled white german wine would be good with fish . but , we're not eating and it's hot out , so i think i'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice .
excuse me , can i have a look at the green coat ?
yes , i like the style . can i try this on ?
me too . i love to play on the swing as well . swing is my favorite .
they are . we can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park .
if you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn .
do you have sport shirts for ladies ?
i think the red one fits me well . can i try it on ?
where is the fitting room ?
the dress looks beautiful . can i touch it ?
i see . what about the dress over there ? i would like to try it on .
are you looking for shoes ?
what about this brown one ?
can i try this dress on ?
well , i like the styte , but i don't think the color fits me . could you bring me a green one ?
could you give me some advice ?
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color , i will like it better .
oh , my god . i am so heavy now . i gain 10 kilos .
i think i should go . i really need to lose some weight .
0k . see you then .
nope , i do not have a membership yet .
i can't find my glasses and i can't see anything . can you help me find a few things ?
where's my pencil ?
that's not a pencil . that's a pen .
how about my backpack ? do you know where that is ?
i don't see them .
thanks .
this one is too small . please bring me a bigger one .
what's the brand ?
i want to buy a black suit .
i prefer single breasted suit .
could i be of any help to you ?
do you like miniskirt ? it's popular among young girls . the pleated skirt also sells well .
do you have the same in different sizes ? the trousers are too long for me .
will the trousers shrink when washed ?
do you get up early every morning ?
no , my little sister lives with me .
ok , lucy . it ' s your turn . are you ready ?
come on ! in the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song !
well , you asked for it . why don't you put on an elvis ' song for him .
who wants to go first ? lily ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
i've been learning to play go recently . it's an amazing game !
at least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? i think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into chinese culture should learn to play go .
sure . it was considered desirable that a well educated ancient chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . i think weigh is the most fantastic of them . it embodies ancient chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness .
yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game , i can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill .
may i take a look at the shoes over there ?
size 24 . are they synthetic or leather ?
try it on in front of the mirror .
is stanley still singing that elvis song ? he's really hogging the mic !
he sounds like a sick cow !
i already tried that . nothing seems to help .
let's go to burger queen for lunch . they have good cheese burgers .
look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . it must be very delicious .
come on . it is worth waiting . their cheese burgers are really popular . once you have it , you will love it .
yup , they have good french fries as well . not very thick , but crispy enough . you should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . that is the belgium style . you will love it .
come on . you just have it once in a while , not every day . it will not harm you .
be patient . good food never comes fast .
hi , is you , john ?
i think chess is more reasonable . you see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . a true battle should be like that . soldiers should outnumber the commanders .
correct ! another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . it seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . they are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . look at the king in chess , he is much more capable .
there's another distinctive contrast . both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 by 9 board , bigger than the 8 by 8 board used in chess .
flip it to channel 9 , will you , janet ? there's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes .
oh , yeah , smarty pants ? over my dead body . now , don't be such a brat and .
i don't know ! the picture went blank all of a sudden . it's probably the picture tube .
do you have cheongsams ?
the styte is ok . which country is this made in ?
can i help you in any way ?
how do you like this pattern ? the pink suits you well .
do you want to buy a sweater ?
the cowl neck pullovers are new in . it sells like hot cakes .
may i help you ?
do you have any style in your mind ?
i recommend you this one . it's a very popular kind of coat the most recent thing .
i think this suit displays your nice finger .
no problem .
are you ready to go shopping ?
good idea . have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ?
let's just get both . do you bring enough money ?
could i speak to mr . wu , please ?
this is kevin .
that's good . you can put one in this room and put the other one in that room .
well , do you want to go outside for dinner ?
hello . i am bili and i made an appointment with you to see the house .
the house is a little too old .
hello . manchester 6739792 .
nicholas ? nicholas nickleby ? no . he doesn't live here any more . he's moved to morecambe .
yes . i've got it somewhere . let me see . where did i put it ? ah i remember , it's on the memo . here it is . do you have a pen to write it down ?
his number's 4945939 .
slow down ! you can't exceed the speed limits .
no , you can not . it is dangerous .
good afternoon .
thank you .
it ’ s half past twelve .
from one to two .
we usually go to the cafeteria .
( having lunch with joseph ) have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ?
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
excuse me . have you got the time ?
i like to drive on freeway .
don't worry . there ' re few cars now .
there's going to be a highway here .
the traffic problem will soon be eased .
how do you spend your day , helen ?
really ? what time do you go to work ?
and when do you get home at night ?
so what do you do , exactly ?
oh , look at those earrings , maria . they're perfect for you .
no , the yellow ones .
well , that necklace isn't bad .
that blue one right there . how much is it ?
hello . 9 1 1 . can i help you ?
what happened ?
give me your address .
all right . the police and an ambulance are on the way . in the meantime , find a clean cloth and press it firmly over the wound . this will slow the bleeding .
mum , pass me some more please !
but the ads say they're most nutritious .
daddy , i want to buy a ten speed sportsman .
no , i'm not asking for money , i'm asking for your advice .
will you look at this form ?
i don't understand some things .
what does mi mean ?
what does mm / dd / yy mean ?
i don't understand .
oh . that's simple enough .
let's go to the animal shelter .
i want to get a puppy for my son .
i'll get him one of those little dogs .
and eat too much .
oh , yes , i took him there yesterday . he showed me one that he really liked .
he wanted to take it home yesterday .
stand back from the door , please . let the passengers off . you can't get on until the other passengers get off .
that's right . move along , please . there are more people waiting to get on . move to the rear .
no , that's the number l that goes down park avenue . this is the number 2 .
it is . get in . please . you ' re holding everyone up . you can't miss washington square park .
you're really fit , paul . do you exercise very much ?
you're kidding !
wow ! how often do you exercise like that ?
what shall we do tonight ?
that's a good idea . we haven't seen a film for ages . what would you like to see ?
i'll be glad when winter comes .
because i love the snow .
last year we made a big snowman .
it was seven feet tall .
it took us all day .
of course . we gave him a big carrot for a nose .
i'm going to the bank .
i need to withdraw some money .
i'll just use the atm .
i just insert my debit card into the machine .
well , it gives me money , but it's my own money .
operator . may i help you ?
just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . or we can place a call for you , if you want .
there you go .
hello ?
what are you doing in australia ?
oh , right . what time is it there ?
yes four o'clock in the morning .
what channel did you watch last night ?
how do you feel about it ?
well , i don't think much about it . to me , it's a sheer waste of time
hey ! are you getting dressed ?
why ? what time is it ?
but it's saturday ! !
no , i'm not . i'm staying in bed .
excuse me . may i see that laptop for a moment ?
no , the one on the left . yes , that ′ s the one . . thank you .
that ′ s impressive ! what ′ s the sale price ?
may i help you , sir ?
any particular colour ?
how about this one ?
well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . will a white one do ?
good morning . are you ready to order ?
would you like anything to drink ?
anything else ?
air mail or surface mail ?
that'll be eighty five cents .
three dollars and forty cents .
oh , no ! ! my son needs a bathroom .
where on grant street ?
thank you very much .
it's time for your bath , young lady .
you need a bath every day .
because you don't want to smell bad .
that's what you think .
i can smell you .
that's my perfume .
yikes ! what was that noise ?
did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
of course i heard that . i thought a plane had crashed into your house .
i will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
what did you say ? i think i've gone deaf .
no problem . first of all , do you want to get a home computer or a laptop ?
yes , they generally cost a little more .
i called hp about my computer .
they said i need a new hard drive .
it's not too much , only about $ 85 .
no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
yes , it's just a couple of screws .
that's a good idea .
no , thanks . just let me sleep until i wake up .
okay . i think i'll be awake by then .
you mean i will smell the food cooking ?
i don't think i'm going to dream about anything . i'm really tired .
something's wrong with my computer .
all i get is a black screen .
i think i know , because this happened before .
my hard drive crashed .
no , i always back up my files .
do you want an ibm compatible pc or a macintosh ?
well , what do you plan to use your computer for ?
welcome to game world . what can i do for you ?
i think i'll get some new goggles .
we also need some sunscreen . what about beach towels ?
i think i'll get a hat , too .
what kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
yes , we do . we also eat mutton .
so are you going to get a new swimsuit ?
why don't you get a bikini ?
you aren't fat . i'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . how about this thong bikini ?
this is a good basic computer package . it's got a good cpu , 256 megabytes of ram , and a dvd player .
yes , it has a built in modem . you just plug a phone line into the back of the computer .
a 15 inch monitor is included in the deal . if you want , you can switch it for a 17 inch monitor , for a little more money .
are you ready ?
ready for the big switch .
the nation is switching to digital tv .
did you buy the converter ?
how much was that ?
does it pick up any digital channels ?
you're in great shape , keith . do you work out at a gym ?
so , how often do you work out ?
say , i like racquetball , too .
uh . how well do you play ?
well , all right . but i'm not very good .
look ! it is not working well . did you try out the bike when you bought it .
but it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride .
there are another six stops .
is it wangfujing ?
ok .
thank you .
is this where i get off ?
all right . and would you like a salad ?
ok . what kind of dressing would you like ? we have vinaigrette , italian , and french .
and would you like anything to drink ?
could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ?
well , you'd better take it out front .
it usually gets here at noon on tuesday , which is tomorrow .
oh , no , you don't .
every morning you get up late and rush off to work late .
you'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it .
excuse me . i'm your new neighbor , jack . i just moved in .
i'm looking for a grocery store . are there any around here ?
ok . and is there a laundromat near here ?
is this the right bus for san francisco ?
when's the first stop ?
thank you .
sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . and alcohol is not allowed .
now i'm sure we'll never get all our things back . they're so clever these criminals . what's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ?
think how happy we were . now this . things always go wrong .
i don't feel like breakfast . i don't feel like anything . why are we so unlucky ? it's as if there were a jinx on us .
jane ! what an enchanting skirt you have on !
bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines . darling , it looks elegant on you ! it can't be any cheap stuff . something around two hundred , i guess .
then you got a windfall ! was sixty five the original price , or did you get a special discount ?
how much did she ask for ?
she must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ?
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china . it's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on open air fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just now i was told by my chinese colleagues i bought it overpriced . i could have talked my way to thirty .
but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?
gosh , it's 7:30 , i'll miss the first class .
is your father in the habit of having naps ?
don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ?
when do you go to bed usually ?
are you ready , pa ?
no .
let's see if we forget anything .
yes , let's go . lock the door , please .
do you like the cookies ?
glad you like it .
i'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?
why is the car before us stopping ?
look . two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . that's why that car stops .
good evening , madam . can i help you ?
anything wrong with it ?
well . please accept our sincere apologies , i'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
really ? why ?
i see . you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
stop talking like my mother . that's what she keeps saying .
what do you mean ? what are you talking about ?
what's your weight .
do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat .
your muscles are a spectacle !
are you a wrestler or a boxer ?
your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so .
i can see you've got some color back in your cheeks .
you've formed a sound habit .
excuse me , ma'am ?
i'm new here and i can ’ t seem to find the lunch room .
aren't you tired ?
hello , darling ! did you have a good day today ?
would you like a drink ?
dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ?
oh . did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ?
good . are you going to the pub tonight ?
i'm going to the shops in a minute . what do we need ?
no problem . we also need bread , so i'll go to the baker's . i'll get some vol au vents for victor's birthday bash on friday . we'll need balloons for that too .
okay . the library's beside the baker's . i'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . they're overdue .
the last thing to be ignored at a chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you'll be considered a well connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
yes , plenty of them . don't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
i have no idea what to buy for mary for her birthday .
yes , that would be good !
if i remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading .
her roommate , malia , might know what her favorite groups are .
let's give malia a call and ask her for her help right now .
in china at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well to do bourgeois lifestyle . coffee is often considered a hobby of the well educated , middle class people .
well . tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . people visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas .
bob ! your eyes look bloodshot . did you not sleep well ?
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china .
you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends .
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .
does tea serving follow any special etiquette in china ? each time i dropped in at my chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether i want it .
so the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . in that case , i guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it .
so next time , i'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ?
i need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday .
how much are the roses ?
that sounds like a good deal .
i'll take a dozen .
no , the roses will be fine .
overseas operator , may i help you ?
i know what you mean there . in many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . and that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . even though we do have a rich variety of brand name wines , like matai and showing yellow rice wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . we just be its dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship .
yeah . it's of supreme importance that the goblet , table cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable .
it's raining heavily .
all right .
no , we can't . it's thundering .
oh , sam ! is this your dog ?
cindy , you're so cute .
i have a little white cat .
yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small .
not at all . they're quiet most of the time . but they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs .
absolutely . believe it or not , i found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago .
yes . it was starving and looking for something to eat when i saw it .
traffic rules are different among countries .
people drive on the right in china .
how can we avoid the jam ?
ok .
usually cities have greater traffic problems .
i hate the car columns on the road .
so you have all the news on broadcast ?
i can't find proper parking space .
no , there's no parking sign .
look , there is traffic accident over there .
john , it ’ s time to get up .
it is . hurry up ! you ’ ll be late for school .
positive . i ’ ll put the radio on .
this is the rush hour .
let's drive off this road .
how often does the bus run ?
oh , here comes a bus !
why do you stop me ?
i'm sorry .
i don't know .
there're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day !
shit , so crowded !
things change every minute .
how long do i have to wait ?
i see . the bus doesn't come so often as in cities .
why ? anything special there ?
oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out .
why not ? it's so cool .
pardon ?
well , i didn't realize that .
oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
excuse me . would you tell me where the people's park is ?
how long will it take me to get there ?
i'm not going in the wrong direction , am i ?
may i take a bus to get there ?
what a terrible house !
the door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking
do you like shopping ?
why don't you do your shopping at home ?
i mean you can buy things through the internet , that is e commerce .
how long have you waited ?
i'll be late because i have waited so long !
i'd better take a taxi .
oh , the bus is gone .
i'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus .
come on in . let me show you the house . isn ' t it something ?
have you ever seen such a nice house ?
this is the kitchen . every thing's new .
i've found a nice place in this district . three bedrooms , a large kitchen .
it sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run down neighborhood .
it's a two bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat in kitchen .
hello , may i help you ?
oh , how nice . they ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
well , gentleman . each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's ok .
when do you want to move in ?
my dear , it's five flights up !
we're little further away from the street and traffic noise
is the place well furnished ?
what about the kitchen ?
and i don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires .
the plumbing seems ok , too .
and the sinks don't seem to leak .
hey , robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . where did you get it ?
true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to china for the first time .
yeah , i have the same feeling . also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . things in a department store are usually quality guaranteed . but at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not .
i'm afraid i forgot to lock the door .
sorry , mum , i'll lock it right away .
that's cool . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but i'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
yeah , if i buy a cell phone like this , i don't have to take a music player everywhere i go , and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .
can i help you ?
certainly . would you like it with ice cream ?
george , did you remember to buy me the book ?
when will you buy it then ?
our housing problem is a highly complicated issue .
right . like our lpf program . the mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their lpf accounts .
willy , i don't think we have much butter . can you buy some ?
here's the money . and get some salt .
i can't believe that .
i've never heard mary cursed anybody . but i heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today .
henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?
we've spent $ 1 , 000 .
do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?
what do you think is the biggest change ?
that's true . you know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more .
i guess i'm a bit old fashioned . i'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room .
how about your other siblings ? do they spend a lot of time with your parents ?
i see . do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?
good afternoon , madam . how can i help you ?
first of all , we'll tailor a work out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs .
well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work out plan .
since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal .
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
wise decision . that is 400 yuan . you'll find it's totally worth it .
hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
and fruits !
i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
why don't you turn off the tv and get outside ? you need to get some fresh air .
really ? what's the series about ?
it sounds interesting , but i am not a big fan of tv shows . they're time consuming and don't have much depth .
really ? that's interesting !
have you ever tried shopping online ?
that's right . seeing is believing .
that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e shop may suddenly disappear .
it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . paying online is much safer than before , but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions .
me too .
yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
have you watched any of the talent shows on tv ?
yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society .
no surprise . the over the top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite .
your mp3 looks so cool . where did you get it ?
really ? do you often shop online ?
wounds good , and i don't have to queue up at the cashier .
well , are there any other advantages ?
are there many choices of online shopping ?
hello . do you know how i can find a room to rent ?
will that work ?
do you like the room ?
$ 300 per month .
do you have any apartment to rent ?
where is it .
is it furnished ?
that's good . when can i go to see the house ?
excuse me , where am i on this map ?
which bus should i take to railway station ?
where am i supposed to change ?
julia , what time is it ?
oh , my god ! i'm going to be late ! i have no time to have breakfast now . ( hurry on his clothes . )
oh , i have a poor memory now . i haven't had enough sleep lately . i had a bad dream just now .
steven , it's ten o'clock . i'm going to bed . i'm beat .
oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? it's already past 10 .
okay . please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . i don't want the dog down there tonight .
you must be mr . sellers . i'm steven . i am here to see the apartment you advertised .
could i have a look at it first ?
it's nice . so this is the bathroom . and that must be the bedroom .
is there air conditioning ?
what's the name of this street ?
do you know of any banks near here ?
can you hold the end of this tape measure ?
i ' m taking some measurements for new curtains .
i thought we'll just fix up the wood floor . and use some paint for the walls .
julia , the apartment i looked at today is pretty decent around 120 square meters .
a new two bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the sanlitun area .
very quiet and safe . and it's got a lot of trees and plants .
yeah , it's near a bus stop .
have you ever thought about your ideal home ?
what would it be like ?
how many rooms would it have ?
how many bathrooms would your dream home have ?
how would you decorate your house ?
how many tvs would your dream home have ?
we need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on .
well , i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better .
we put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account .
yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook .
excuse me , can you tell me where central park street is ?
is it far ?
i see . thanks a lot .
excuse me , where is the nearest bank ?
excuse me , how do i get to the forbidden city ?
is it far ?
excuse me . could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema ?
will it take me long to get there ?
it ’ s so great to be here ! i ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
that ’ d be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ?
that would be lovely , thanks .
i ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
well , i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but i don ’ t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
oh dear . well , i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here .
i see . well , i can help with the chores while i ’ m here . you two could probably use my help .
excuse me , ma'am . can you tell me where the nearest postoffice is ?
do you mean that i go that way for one block , then turn right ?
is it far ?
thank you very much .
would you like to see our new shirts ?
and not expensive either .
everybody's buying them .
yes , they are very fashionable , you see .
excuse me , is there a hotel nearby ?
how can i get there ?
can you tell me the way to library ?
is it on xinhua street ?
alright , tell me what you think .
yeah , maybe you ’ re right . how about this outfit ?
no , i don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it ’ s casual , yet sophisticated .
that ’ s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
that ’ s even better than the real thing .
this suit looks nice . can i try it on ?
can i help you ?
hello , may i speak to kevin , please ?
hello , i ’ d like to speak to kate .
it ’ s ok . i ’ ll call her back latter . thank you .
how much is this shirt , please ?
do you have it in a larger size ?
your daughter will be back soon . i'm going to start making dinner . you can just watch some tv in tv room if you like . we just bought a new tv with a lcd screen . the remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair .
this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax .
ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . here's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
that's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
fine . i'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .
i don't think it's broken .
excuse me , do you go to the central park ?
could you please tell me when i get to the central park ?
( a few minutes later . ) should i get off at the next stop ?
is it a long ride ?
ok . i know . thank you .
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?
yes , i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
i wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
do me a favor , and take a taxi . it'd make me feel a lot better .
when i first moved in , i walked everywhere . but within a week , i had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! now , i always take public transportation .
nothing else has happened to me , but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
excuse me , i ’ ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes . do you know why the traffic is so heavy ?
oh , what a terrible situation ! this traffic is unbearable .
i agree with you . but now we have to wait . the sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . i fear a thunder storm is brewing .
yes , i hope so . thank you for telling me this .
julia , julia , julia . my daring julia , what's wrong with you ?
yes , i have called you three times . what makes you in a daze ?
did someone get hurt ?
what a terrible accident ! who should be responsible for this traffic accident ?
why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ?
hello ! is your taxi engaged ?
please take me to the honging hotel .
could you get there in twenty minutes ?
i am in a hurry . please take a shortcut . i have a friend waiting for me .
fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time .
i promise . we're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for .
do you have any money ?
for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street .
i agreed to not go into the mall , but i can still look at things in the market !
what time does the museum close ? any idea ?
what time is it now ?
what do you think about this store ? i heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .
don ’ t worry . i ’ ve decided that for your birthday i ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
i do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift !
how about this red dress ? i think it would really suit you .
here you go . on any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today .
let me look . let ’ s see . they ’ ve got one in blue , green , pink , black . and white . here you are .
i think you look fantastic . happy birthday !
steven , you are always looking in good shape . how do you keep it ?
and ?
oh , no wonder you are healthy .
thanks for sharing your experience with me .
how is your house hunting going ?
how much are you looking to spend ?
looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .
well , if you want to live in london , you have to pay the price !
i can ask around at work . do you have a preference for makers or non smokers ?
how long do you want to sign a contract for ?
do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?
it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities .
don ’ t worry . sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children .
julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing .
i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight .
i am worrying about it too . i want to install a security door .
yes , i think so . the security door is so firm that nobody can break in .
mr . sellers ? it's steven speaking , your tenant . we've just suffered a power failure . what should i do now ?
yes , i do .
how do i know if it's blown out ?
then what shall i do ?
how do i get to the post office from school ?
ok , i see . thank you very much .
what's your apartment like ?
what is it like living in on campus housing ?
did you have to pay a deposit ?
how long is your contract for ?
have you started looking yet ?
have you moved into your new house yet , michael ?
so , what do you think about the place ? are you glad that you moved in ?
how old is the house then ?
sounds fascinating . where is your new house located ?
is your house well lit ?
how many rooms does your house have ?
it costs a lot of money . hospital bills had already made deep in roads into our savings . do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ?
we have to cut back on our shopping from now on .
oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! no wonder there are few people .
yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . you don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?
when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .
make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .
that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .
exactly ! oh , my god ! i love britney ! i'm going to get it .
it's just the right size a perfect fit ! i'll take it . oh , no , i'm a little short . did you bring your credit card ?
how far is it from here to the airport ?
i need to get there before ten . can we make it ?
julia , i have good news for you .
i have earned a lot of money this week , more than i do in a fortnight .
my wages are six hundred dollars a week . but i find a part time job to supplement my income .
i know , darling . i must earn enough money to buy a car . i do a part time job to increase my income . don't worry , i will take care of myself .
hey ayden , i was wondering if you could do me a favor .
it's kind of a big favor . i'm absolutely flat broke , and i owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until friday to give it to her , but i don't get paid until next monday . do you think you could loan me some cash until i get paid ?
if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . i'll pay you back on monday . i promise .
thanks a lot ayden . every little bit will help . tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .
how about at 6 pm ?
yes , sir . where would you like to go ?
is it the one on xi shut street ?
the checkroom is just behind the front door .
here we are . this is wangfujing street .
25 yuan , please .
where can i call a taxi ?
good morning . what can i do for you , sir ?
sure . come to look at these styles . they sell very well .
how about these ? they are the current bestsellers .
yes , i will find one for you . here you are . it's made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft .
steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ?
but sunday is the same with saturday . if you don ’ t mind , that's ok .
i see . we will go the day after tomorrow .
i want to buy some clothes in clothing store . when we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
we really were lucky . we got the last available table for two and we didn't even have a reservation ! did you see the long lines behind us ?
let's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
what's in a dahl ?
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
that's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
ok , shall i flag down the waitress ?
you're right . that might seem a bit rude . it's a good thing i've got you with me !
excuse me , could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?
that ’ s a really long line . how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?
can i buy stamps here ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
no .
and the bubble wrap ?
this shirt is really nice .
ok . i'll try on a medium size .
it's too big tor me . do you have a smaller one ?
how much is it ?
it s a little overpriced . is there any discount on this laptop ?
is it the final price ?
excuse me , how can i get special discount coupons ?
can i get a discount coupon if i buy these goods ?
can i buy everything in the supermarket by it ? .
how long can i keep it ?
i see . i will take 9 bags of sugar so that i can get 3 coupons .
hi , i want to check out .
can i pay by a credit card ?
ok . here is the money .
would you wrap it for me ?
hi , welcome to rental property management . how can i help you ?
okay . our rental agent will be with you in a moment .
excuse me , can you tell me where the breakfast cereals are ?
are the snack foods in that area , too ?
excuse me , do you have the latest issue of newsworld ?
how about music madness ?
excuse me , i'm looking for your 3 liter pepsis , the ones that are on sale this week . there don't seem to be any in the soft drink section .
yes , i would , thank you .
can i help you ?
what size are you ?
well , you've come to the right place . what kind of watch are you looking for ?
this one is $ 500 .
let me suggest this one . it's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 .
uh , no . analog watches don't come with stopwatches . you'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch .
right here .
yes . make it out to time after time .
good morning . sir . how may i serve you today ?
sure . large or medium ?
anything else to go ?
you've got it .
sure . it's seven eighty nine .
we are here .
the total is 45 yuan .
it is 45 yuan on the meter .
no . i am sure about that .
this is my favourite restaurant .
yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before .
oh yes . like this , for example . have you ever eaten jellyfish before ?
what about these ? have you ever tried pig ’ s brains ?
that was a really good meal , gordon .
well , it is getting pretty late . i think we should go home .
what are you talking about ? we'll split the bill .
no way , gordon . i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . there's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
that's better . this way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
you've got a deal .
next time you buy veggies or fruits , have them bagged and weighed before you come here .
the total comes to us $ 65 . 81 . how will you pay today ?
slide your card through the card id pad and punch in your pin .
one moment . do you want to withdraw some cash while you're at it ?
paper or plastic ?
do you want paper or plastic bags for your groceries ?
it's very thought provoking , isn't it ?
so what do you think of the american fast food culture ?
and everyone knows that americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ?
but i think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants
such as fat free milk , whole wheat rolls and fish sandwich .
but i'm not sure if they're well rcceived .
well , americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods .

maybe we could get some new furniture . better stuff .
you see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth the wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . they do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
a young french fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , when i fastened the cord and walked to the platform , i was extremely nervous . when i looked down , i was nervous even more . if the cord had broken , i would be knocked to bake meat . however , i knew my worries were unwanted . i was afraid if i retreated others might say something about me . i had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . i only felt wind wiring at my ears . my body rapidly descended . i thought that after only seven or eight seconds i was rebounded to upper air by the cord . in fact it was 30 seconds . maybe because of my nervousness , i only felt seven or eight seconds . when rebounding to the high altitude , i felt a sudden sense of relief . i did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable .
home at last . tonight we have a lot of homework though .
to tell the truth , i don ’ t really like him either . he ’ s kind of boring and not very active . he always looks unhappy too .

i've tried diets before but they've never worked .
i work so hard that i do not have the energy to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet , i am still getting fatter .
i know you're right , but what can i do ?
but i'll miss the news . it's important in my business to keep up with events in china .

i ’ m sorry . i ’ m not interested in it .
alison , would you like to have some more ?
actually you haven't had much .
that sounds ridiculous . why ?
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
so you are watching your weight , aren't you ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
that's the one .
yeah . if we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
where is that ?
( while driving ) are you in a hurry ?
we'll make it except a jam . you know it's rush hour .
do you have small bills ?
excuse me , when is the next train to los angeles ?

at 9:36 . and the 9:18 gets to london at 9:55 , the 10:32 at 11:09 .

sorry , not before 10:30 .
one way or round trip ?
$ 15 . and for a hard one , only $ 6 .
excuse me . does this train go to brooklyn ?

what's the matter ?
oh , you have to take the shuttle to grand central .

oh you ought to go to the park next time . they have a route for joggers there .
hello . city news . can i help you ?
okay . what ’ s your account number ?
and your address , please ?
when do you want it cancelled ?
sorry to have smoked in your room .
it ’ s very kind of you .
what do you usually have for breakfast ? pancakes or waffles ?
but isn't it served with cold milk ?
chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
but i'm open to new things . i'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
a westerner said to his chinese friend . “ chinese people slurp when drinking soup . it ’ s disgusting . ” the chinese friend replied , “ westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . it ’ s even worse . ”
not really . i did some research about chinese table manners . the important rule is to remain silent while eating . of course , this refers to family meals only . not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . it is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . the table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . each dish should be placed in the correct position . when fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . if it is in winter , the stomach should face the right hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . the diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . no noise should be made when chewing . no one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . one should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . all these table manners are very similar to western habits .
please lend me some money .
yeah , i really want it . i am on my uppers .
kids are always difficult to control .
excuse me . do you know where i can find the nearest iccc ?
how do i get there on foot ?
wait , let me write this down . alright , i'm ready .
square . turn right . traffic lights . and then ?
thank you very much .
i really don ’ t understand my parents . they always make light of my worries .
but the child has his own feeling .
dad , you've been driving for three hours . why don't we have a switch ?
have you been drinking ?
if you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment .
excuse me . when ' s the next bus ?
oh , good . that ' ll be the number forty four ?
so when's the next forty four ? will it be here soon ?
so when will it be here then ?
never ?
did you promise me to get the bread ?
but you forgot to get the bread .
you are free . you can go now .
i'll do with the cake .
john , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? the lawn needs weeding .
well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
would you like to clear the table then ?
yes , i want to go out . would you like to come ?
hello , may i help you ?
oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
well , each room is 40 dollars a week .
when do you want to move in ?
fine , i'll be expecting you .
why aren't you doing your homework ?
oh , is it ? you'll be making records next , will you ?
you'd better get on with your homework ! you can practice on sunday .
i certainly could . you ' ll get exams next month .

the software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things .
right you are , paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus .

there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick .
so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four hundred dollar camera for twenty bucks .
yes .
i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .
he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .
c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect looking box .
what ? your diamond ring is lost ?
it must have been stolen by the few thieves . i ’ ll get it back for you .
don ’ t be angry with them . after all , they are still children .
if i were you , i would not put crime in their doing these thing . we should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track .
you should not have criticize your son in front of his friends .
i know . but at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds .
what a mess , jack !
the new year is coming . is the final examination approaching .
how are you getting along with your studies ?
i have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children .
my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely .
where is our son , dear ?
what happened ? have you talked with him ?
dad , can you buy a new camera ? my old one has gone west .
so , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . this time how about a better one ?
let regive you a hand .
but you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play .
i really don ’ t know how to teach my son . he's getting far above himself .
jack , let ’ s go !
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
what a washing machine ! it ’ s getting worse today . look ! now it doesn ’ t work at all . i think i need a new one .
i don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ?
but each children has his own interest .
please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out .
but we need the exact time . what time ?
can you please give me a hand ? i can ’ t carry the heavy box .
i think you are flicking through it .
sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . i have to deal with it . perhaps i will go to back home till very late .
oh , come on . i will be back as early as possible .

can you help me now ?

there are so many eating utensils on the table . which ones do i use first ?
i see . a set for appetizers and another for the main course .
oh yeah . the big napkin goes on my lap .
cindy , help me order because i'm still not very familiar with american cooking .
why didn ’ t you call me last night ?
why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ?

you're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed .
you know , you really ought to get a new pair of jeans . those are falling to pieces .
well , peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ?
of course , you have . you must try harder this time .
no , you needn't do that . you'd better get a part time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . you have to take a job and study .
ah ! it hurts . don't touch it .
the shoulder .
it's not a cut . it's a gash ! it's bigger than a cut ! ah ! i need a doctor .
i'm bleeding too much .
yes . my bike has one under the seat . get it , quick !
no , forget that ! do the tourniquet first . i'm losing too much blood .
i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts !
i'm lucky i wasn't killed . i must have been going around forty five miles an hour . there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out .
well , i'm glad you're finally back . i was wondering what happened .
why ?
you got lost . you're kidding !
you've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
i don't know . where ?
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
hmm , maybe i do .
you were too busy looking at joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
excuse me .
i just checked in , and there's a problem with my room .
i asked for a non smoking room , and i don't have one . my room smells like cigarette smoke . i can't stand it . could you change my room , please ?
thank you .

i'm sorry , but i really need it this afternoon .
sure . that's no problem .
here you go . anything else ?
there was a serious disturbance in the street this morning .
how silly of you to jump out of the window !

maybe the situation is too urgent .
where did you lose it ? maybe i can help you to find it .
the taxi drivers are on strike again .
they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
could you help me with these books ?
please , george .
tell me what ’ s the matter with you , bill .
i don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . he says painful words everyday .
he says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if i do something that he doesn ’ t like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
it ’ s easy to say , but i will try .
paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . so , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ?
i do it , too . you know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . and if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . he does it very often . i really get mad . i can ’ t help spank him sometimes .
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .
wow , it has a balcony .
how many windows are there in the apartment ?
it ’ s just what i want . i think i am ready to sign .
before you send the lease , do you have any questions ?
it includes everything except cable tv , and telephone .
it usually comes out about $ 40 a month .
no , i am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted .
why do you want to eat western food so much today ? anything special to celebrate ? did you get a promotion ?

wow . what fillings do you recommend ?
daddy , i love this happy farmhouse . it's really fun .
but you are holding it for me . nothing to worry about . i trust you . oops , what's that ?
i see . why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ?
come on , daddy . you can see that people only pick the red ones .
oh , then what would happen if there were pests ?
i learned of the railway accident only this morning .
is that true ?
what's all the security check about , jimmy ? does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ?
i don't know . maybe the same . actually , this is my first time being in a bar .
sure . i love this place , especially the decoration . so tasteful !
yes , orange juice will be fine for me . but how can you get the drink ? it's so crowded there around the counter . you can barely move .
daddy , what's next ? what else do we do now ?
great . let's go . where is it ?
we have many cookies left here . can we use them as baits ?
so let's go and catch earth worms !
daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? we've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing .
i love sashimi . did mom bring any soy sauce for that ?
cool . hey , i've got an idea . why don't we cook it separately ? half for sashimi , and the other half for grill .
can you please give me a hand ? i can ’ t carry the heavy box .
i think you are flicking through it .
i don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ?
but each children has his own interest .
may i be of any assistance ?

let's start to study how to use computers , paler . it's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software .
the hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes .
the software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things .
right you are , paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus .
that's great ! we made 20 minutes earlier .
mom , you are the best !
mom , come on . what are you thinking about ?
don't tell me you want me to do that ?
but i don't like playing the piano . and the homework keeps me busy enough .
excuse me , can i use your computer to type my paper ?

have a seat over there . i'll pack it up for you right away .
can i help you , ma'am ?
cool phone . what kind of phone card do you want ?

you know students use tested message service . and they provide favorable service for that .
oh , there is a sales promotion for it now .
sure . as many as you want .
can i have my check , please .
may son adores my new hairstyle so i suppose it is worth it .
thank you .
wow , it's surprising . so what do i get ?
probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i can't afford now .
you mean i should make an appointment ahead of time ?
here is your change and your receipt . do you have goods unpaid on you , sir
i'm sorry i need to call the security to have a look .
sure . ah . that's the problem . have you paid for it
let me see . oh , i am awfully sorry sir .
may's birthday is coming . shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ?
you are such a good father . it's next sunday .
what about a cell phone ? she is old enough to have one .
maybe we can try shopping on line .
i'm sure that may would love the pink one .
totally . computers bring with them convenience . oh , what's wrong ?
the government is going to organize a folk custom activity at the end of the month . and our community is supposed to put on a performance .
stuff like that but i think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous .
good idea . shall we get everyone in the community ?
i know that they already have a range dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals .
we can raise money in the community . you know each family 10 yuan maybe .
be quick . put our bags in the deposit box .
i told you to hurry up a thousand times . you just put a deaf ear to it .
i surely did ! ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there .
it's all your fault ! now we can't get in shopping .
what color do you want ?
good morning , may . good girl , you are reading english books again .
oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . we call her lulu .
yes . just look at her colorful feathers . what else can it be ?
really ? a foreign parrot !
maybe you can teach lulu some english words .
mom , i'm starving .
my teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . you ?
you are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual .
then it's for dad , isn't it ? it's so unfair !
what was that again ?
i'm sorry , i didn't know that . but i wanna help .
i'll get knee to knee with her .
ant shirley , it's being years since we last met . how were you doing in the passing years ?
fine . where are the other guys ?
bad timing . i want to see them so much . how are they ?
yes , that's why i'm here . i'm thinking about buying a second hand apartment .
no , that will be too expensive .
my first job's salary will be a bit low . so the cheaper the better . just one i can afford .
poor danny . you are so enfeebled !
mom called just now saying that she and dad will be back later . do you want to speak to them on phone ?
whatever . have a drink of water .
maybe later . i think we have a medicine kit .
probably on the of the cabinet . i'll go and get it .
oh , here it is . patulin . oh , no !
keep lying down . the matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration .
what a beautiful day !
i was worried about canceling the climbing .
what about taking the cable car ?
wow , what a long queue this is !
daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . they roll all the way up to the sky .
so you wanna stay here ?
that's unfair , mom .
dad is bigger than you , but how come i'm smaller than may .
what should i do ?
got it , mom .
mom , don't worry about me , i can do it .
excuse me . i seem to have lost my son .
shirley .
daniel .
he is in a blue sportswear and a white sportsshoes . about 1 . 4 meters .
do you know how happy i am ? the ant kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . it seems like the air is fresh here .
come on baby , stop trying to pretend like a man . if you go there , you are sure to like them .
i said you are sure to like them . there is the grand parade of ants carnival in a few minutes in the square . you will experience a dream of fantasy .
all kinds of insects dress themselves up . they drive straight their own flower cars along the parade avenue of ants kingdom .
i thought you had grown out of such child practices .
gross !
wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . i'd like to take a ride on it .
look at your right hand . is it the zone of the lost maya kingdom ?
wow , that's my favorite . it's like a superman shooting right up into the sky .
of course . after this , i want to show you to the haunted house .
bingo !
the fried shrimp is crunchy ! but my mom will never cook shrimp this way . she always says that fried food is not healthy .
she often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water .
my mom says it has a lot of fat . i also suggest you do not eat so many fried things .
really ? i really want to have a try !
thanks . i am starving . tom , what are you getting ?
let me see . what's this , shrimp rolls ?
twenty five yuan is a little expensive .
sounds nice . we will take this , two bowls of shrimp rolls .
we will have this one first and order something else later .
i'm afraid not , sir .
but i saw a red car always parking here before .
maybe . but the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
could you wait for a minute , sir ? i'd like to have a check .
sorry , sir , my mistake . this is your parking space .
how big is this parking lot in our community ?
so you guys should be always busy .
i bet it is always full of cars .
what is the hourly rate for a car like this ?
how mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ?
you've just scratched my car . oh , god , a paint was scratched off .
no , mine !
i've just had it repainted .
i am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful .
i am sorry for damaging your car , sir .
the car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ?
there aren't enough buses in this city , are there ?
that's too much of hassle . we just want a little bigger parking space .
no . but i'm gonna . you know , several months ago , i backed into red honda when parking .
no , right here in the parking lot . it was parked right here in your space . the left rearview mirror was smashed .
yes ! how do you know that ?
excuse me , i'm lost . can you show me where i am in this map ?
i am supposed to go to liu ichang .
yes . yes . can you tell me how to get there ?
excuse me , did you see a set of keys ?
five keys and a small foot ornament .
well , can you help me look for it ? that's my first time here .
it's very kind of you .
oh , thank god ! i don't know how to thank you , guys .
may i help you , sir ?
should i take a look at your battery ?
your car is ready .
daddy , are you going to the park with us this weekend ?
so you can't go with us , right ?
daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . you should have a rest on weekends .
daniel wants to go to the aquarium . while mom wants to visit the summer palace .
yeah . i don't agree with them , but i don't have a better choice .
right , ah . it is so close to our home . how come we've never thought of that ?
may , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?
yes . it says it will be sunny all day . no sign of rain at all . this is your father's favorite sausage . sandwiches for you and daniel .
okay . please take some fruit salad and crackers for me .
all set . may , can you help me take all these things to the living room ?
ask daniel to give you a hand ?
look , dad , many people are doing morning exercises here .
really ? you were so happy then .
daddy , don't mention it .
dad , i'd like to take a picture with the status .
daddy , we can't have a photo of the whole family . we can take one here .
hey , look , there is a circus show over there .
it's the circus .
oh , come on , they give them treat too . oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
oh , it is coming to us , come on , ben , get a banana to it .
why are you acting so strange today ?
that's ok , ben , just let it go . i thought you were just a little too much into it .
honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now .
now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters .
i want to adopt a cat , and it can be barbie's boyfriend too .
that's all right . at least i got myself left .
i hope that he would grant me with that .
aunt shirley , i heard the yuan miao festival is the name for the festival . why did it get its name ?
can you recommend some must try ?
what ’ s that ? it gets the name from the festival itself . that ’ s really funny !
oh , i know tangyuan . it ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert .
i ’ d like to try the salty ones . where does that strange smell come from ?
daddy , i am so glad you come out with us .
it doesn't matter . but i really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time .
it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano .
ahh , i was not available last sunday . i was too busy almost as much as you .
the tea smells good . what tea is it ?
what's special about it except its pleasant smell ?
they must have some special methods to do this during the process .
what's the advantage about tea ?
does that mean the stronger the better ?
got it . what's the proper time for tea ?
why ?
there are many art craft items in this shop . i suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .
if you have any problem , please come to me .
you are an expert on it . that wood carving is very rare . but i'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
so that means you are shopping for presents ?
actually , i think the paper cuts is ok , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . they think that is a miracle .
i have collected different kinds of paper cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
as a matter of fact , i open the shop because i'm interested in the arts . i spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
aunt cindy , do you shop online often ?
last week , i tried to buy some books online , but i didn't know how to pay for them ?
are there many things online ?
oh , what's this ? second hand cellphone store ?
really ? how to do that ?
oh , i got it . it simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . mom will love it . she loves shopping in supermarkets .
are there any disadvantages about it ?
honey , which hand should i use to hold the fork ?
got it . it's so troublesome to have western food . i've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it .
yeah . which restaurant are we going to tonight ?
fine . i believe in cindy's taste . oh , what should i wear ?
i don't want to mess it up . please do it for me . i'm going to the bank to cash some money . how much do we need ?
honey , you are a good accountant . so i'd better leave that to you , too .
i'll take care of the order .
don't forget about the dessert .
wow ! they've got everything here . all the world's famous brands . aunt cindy , what is your favorite brand ?
oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason .
i see . come here . the high heels here look really attractive . but i wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?
it's not a simple thing to be beautiful .
yeah , very tasteful . and with them , you look even more fashionable . oh , there are so many french perfumers . oops , perfumes for guys ? so strange !
oh , really , that's really something new . i'm afraid not everyone can accept it .
that's true . well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . so , do you spend all your money on it ?
how is it that you are my mom's sis ? you two are so different . she always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . you do so much better than her .
here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . you can have a taste then make your decision then . here is the wine menu .
oh , no . but cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . and we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . here are the pictures . pick out something you like .
what would you like for appetizer and dinner ?
how do you want your steaks , rare , medium or well done ?
anything for dessert ?
what can i do for you ?
ok , let me see . this white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry cleaned .
yes , the cost for dry cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . but for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' .
did it ever shrink or fade ? generally speaking , the dark colored clothes always fade away gradually .
never mind . you can leave them to me .
it's very simple . divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . if you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know .
hi , i come to pick up my laundry . this is the invoice .
well , oh my god , there is another problem , i'm afraid . there is still a stain on the shirt .
oh , that's so bad . i know little about that . is there a remedy for it ?
ok , i will .
thanks a lot .
never mind . what about taking a look around the theater ?
not really . they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?
no , no , no . they are all handmade , girl . you know , the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
good morning . vane theater , at your service .
well , there will be charity performance on saturday night . and also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night .
sure . it's to raise money for the homeless .
oh , it's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
it surely is . and the cast is really the best .
wow , this is amazing . i'm glad we've come here . so cool .
hey , look over there . it seems that there is something interesting going on . let's go and have a look .
see that . it's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
you are right . but what if the avalanche happened ?
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
can i help you , sir ?
what kind of presents do you want ?
ok . how about some very cool sneakers for your children ? anyway , it won't cost you much . it's only around $ 59 . 95 for each pair . it might be cheaper than that in america .
just a hunch , sir .
$ 59 . 95 .
sorry , sir .
because in this duty free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife .
that's good . and i can also recommend you a good one . it's the brand of deny .
it's $ 60 here .
of course not , sir .
i love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine .
sure . the sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings .
nothing special . food , drinks , and daniel's kangaroo toys .
he said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do .
science ? what are you talking about ? forget about your science , ok ? it's a picnic !
i can't agree on that . just cut it out . give him a break and don't spoil the day .
what can i do for you , young man ?
what sizes do you need ?
here you are . and here are three crash helmets .
well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . first , make sure they don't go far from the railings .
that's a good idea . and remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
never go to the center of the lake . the ice there is too thin to skate on .
i just got a call from mrs . fitzgerald . see what your willie has just done .
because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again .
that was last time . this time it's worse .
well , he was playing baseball with some friends .
true , but that's not all . the ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window .
and then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . mrs . fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish .
stop interrupting me . finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with mrs . fitzgerald .
thank you .
yeah . i was in a hurry and i forgot my umbrella today .
oh , that ’ s very kind of you . i am going to the garden hotel .
calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ?
i ’ m sorry . i guess i ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank .
so how's everything going for christmas ?
what's that ? don't tell me you've still got christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours .
he still doesn't know that santa isn't real ? how old is he , eight ?
you think it's better that he should be told ?
that happened to my oldest girl . she became really upset when her classmates told her santa wasn't real .
grandpa , this seat is for you , for you are the eldest person here and also it's your birthday today .
i'm afraid i can't do that . it's dad's seat , according to the book about table manners .
great . that's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake .
why do they serve up the noodles first ? i don't like it . where is the cake ?
want to send out for some chinese ?
some chinese food . i'm hungry , and there's a take out restaurant near here . we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat .
okay . i could go for that . it's called al's steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i can't finish what i've ordered .
grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! how long ago was it built ?
oh , it's interesting . dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . now , it's my turn .
i'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca cola .
then there is nothing particular i'd like to eat . grandpa , what's your favorite here ?
sure . is it sweet ?
great , i want it spicy .
i want it to be special . and you know that i always like hot food .
sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . i have to deal with it . perhaps i will go to back home till very late .
oh , come on . i will be back as early as possible .
what ? your golden watch is lost ?
it's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black .
sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? it's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .
are you serious ? how can that be ?
come on . you know , you can never really win . the salesperson never loses . they make their living out of it .
oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !
really ? oh , this one . i like the cloisonn vase .
come on . they look so cheap . something else , please .
don't underestimate his taste . i don't think he'd like it .
yeah . well , anyway , it's up to you . but i can tell that you come here often .
hey , terry , have all the players got here ?
ok . by the way , the stadium is terrific .
we are lucky to play in a new stadium .
look out . catch the ball . you should dunk besides the three point line .
just calm down . it's just a turnover . make up your mind and we can shoot well .
no problem , i once played a 2 meter high player successfully .
but that game he dunked over me for 13 times .
oh , look , what's happened to jack ? he sat down .
tom , is jenny crying ?
she ’ s your sister . what she asked was only duck soup for you . why can ’ t you be good to her ?
dad , you've been driving for three hours . why don't we have a switch ?
trust me . i've been driving for two years .
what can i do ?
did you go to any illegal website ?
yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that .
that's wise .
one minute . oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software .
of course . you'd better learn something about it .
don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . and i take an anti virus software with me . do you want me to install it now ?
what did the boss say ?
you are still student so i don't think you should have time for that .
okay , then . what kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ?
sounds interesting . especially that we are olympic volunteers .
and a good way to get some pocket money .
i'll say yes . wait a minute . i need an ic card .
dad , hurry ! the train is coming . aha , i am a superman .
oh , we should . there are so many people . what if the train got full before we could get in ?
how many stops are there to the aidan station ?
oh , my god !
because i need to use the restroom . is there a restroom on the train ?
why not ? you told me that subway is a kind of train . if it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
oh , yeah , but not today . i am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .
i'm from england and i'm trying to make a travel plan for today .
i'm a flight attendant and i'm here on vacation .
yes , it is . do you know where i can get a town map ?
daniel , here is some money for the tickets .
oh , like a gentleman . two tickets for two people .
they may unless we get a half price ticket for you .
you may ask if you can take a half price ticket .
i've heard that you provide very good service , so when i need a mover , i call you guys first .
oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . it is about 15 kilometers to get there .
how much will it cost in that case ?
your charge is divided into two parts , the payment in advance and the rest . i thought that i should pay all of it before moving .
the damage and compensation item confuses me . could you give some explanation ?
that was really a nightmare !
i was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .
i pressed the emergency button ! and then i stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .
a little bit , but i know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least i wouldn't be smothered there .
of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .
yes . i have to call the property management .
hi , my name is ted , what's yours ?
i said , i'm ted , who are you ?
do you come here often , laura ?
let's go outside and talk . so laura , do you come here often ?
no , this is my first time here .
yeah , that's why i'm here . my friends dragged me here , because they think i spend too much time studying .
why are you reading the classifieds ? what do you need ?
are you having any luck ?
do you mind if i go with you ?
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining , but i had a problem the other day at kimble's department store .
so what do you think of my new dress ?
i bought it for one hundred and forty five dollars at helen's boutique . i didn't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
come in and have some coffee , anna . the kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .
they spend hours there , especially on weekends .
i know several . but wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
hey joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
why not ? when i go shoe shopping , i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
what do you mean ? this is a big store , isn't it ?
so how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
well , you're in the right store . if they don't have it , no one will .
sir , may i please see your license and registration ? do you know how fast you were going ?
you're not sure ? you were going at 90 miles per hour ! that's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! have you been drinking ?
then how can you explain your behavior ?
not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ?
on a cell phone ?
let ’ s move out of here . this apartment is too small .
a house would be great . i could plant a garden . and you could use the garage for a workshop .
how much is the rent ?
when is the place available ?
i can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in new york city .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
can you tell me how to reach the bank please ?
i have an air pass card and i want to withdraw money from the bank .
how do i get there . i have no knowledge of this area .
it sounds very complicated . how far is it from here ?
oh , i would really appreciate that . by the way will i be going north or south ?
what does a housing go for in south mountain district ?
we ’ re looking for a three bedroom home .
under 300 , 000 rib , we suppose .
i see .
hey there chris , what are you up to ?
oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
so this would be your first automobile ?
yeah , i think i can understand your wife's position . asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
so it's time to buy your very first car ! wow , that's exciting !
yeah . i still remember my first car . it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned 17 . i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
yeah , it is a tough call . each one has its pros and cons . are you looking for a sedan ?
this house is very nice for me , but i can ’ t afford it in a lump sum .
that ’ s good . will you tell me the details ?
how long will it take ?
i need to talk it over with my wife .
i heard you are looking for a house .
i can recommend an apartment for you . a friend of mine is about to move . she doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer .
it is on spring avenue .
it ’ s $ 240 a month .
it includes water , but not gas and electricity .
yes , it is .
certainly ! but i have to contact my friend first .
are you looking for an apartment ?
i think i have just a right apartment for you .
yes . it has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens .
yes , it ’ s brand new .
it ’ s $ 8 . 50 a month .
we can take a see by there now if you like . the landlord left me a set of keys with me .
hello , matt !
wow , like how do they train the dogs ?
well , how many dogs do they train at a time ?
do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ?
oh , wow , that's cool . um , why do people keep pets ?
yeah , that's true . ok , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ?
hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? i ’ m starving .
out ? what do you mean out ?
dad and mom ?
you mean this is going to be a regular thing ?
i know . i know . i'm really sorry . i lost my bag .
is there anything wrong ?
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
oh , she can make her own decisions .
believe me . everything will be ok .
hi , jone , how are you ?
what's wrong ?
oh , no ! did you call the police ?
you ’ re home late today , david . how was school ?
oh , what ’ s she like ?
is she old or young ?
can she speak chinese ?
um , this steak , i asked for to be medium rare .
would you like to see our new shirts ?
but they ’ re very nice , you know .
and not expensive either .
everybody is buying them .
i see .
please show me the menu , miss .
yes . i'd like an italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles .
excuse me , i'd like to make a suit of this material .
yes . should i take off my coat ?
please make a single breasted .
how much does it cost ?
all right . when can i get it ?
would you please make a skirt for me with this material please ?
when can i get it ?
thank you , see you then .
what are you going to do ? are you going to work late ?
an apartment ? why ?
where are you living now ?
how are you going to find an apartment ?
apartments in the city are expensive .
but we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . i think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
well , only you liked it really , darling .
tom , you promised to cut the lung . you won't forget , will you ?
and you'll repair the television , won't you ?
do you promise ?
and tom , you will help johnny with his homework , won't you ?
but you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ?
tom , darling . you'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? please !
hi . you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . what would you like me to do ?
ok , i ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . i ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . i always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . . wow ! you can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on tv !
which spices are you going to add to the meat ?
yes . we don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! ok . i ’ m really to do the meat . should i cook it over a low flame ?
right . what are you doing over there ?
mark , you are not telling me the truth . now why ?
yes , all right . so why ? go on then . say it . oh , really , mark . i promise i'm not going to be angry . now why were you late ?
you forgot ? you .
are you ready to go shopping ?
good idea . have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
let ’ s get both . we need some coffee too . is that on your list ?
i ’ m not sure . i ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when i can see what they have . have we got enough money ?
did you promise me to get the bread ?
but you forgot to get the bread .
well , i certainly did .
you are free . you can go now .
i'll do with the cake .
ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . i don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ?
it looks too big for you , but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
i might get one too , but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while .
i ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? i ’ d like to get some jeans too , but i don ’ t have enough cash on me .
good morning . i understand that you ’ ve got a problem with your washing machine . i ’ m from the repair company .
when did it first break down ?
is it still under warranty . if it is and i can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .
ok . i ’ ll start by looking at the motor . i ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine . oh , yes . there ’ s the problem . it ’ s quite simple . i ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes .
part of the motor is loose . i can put it back in place quite easily .
hey there , you look a little lost . are you new here ?
you can always spot the newbies . i can give you a few pointers if you want . were you trying to use this machine here ?
it ’ s ok , i know how it is . this machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
do i need to take a bus ?
how do i get there on foot ?
wait , let me write this down . alright , i'm ready .
square . turn right . traffic lights . and then ?
tall building . which side is the building on ?
thank you very much .
so can you fix it ?
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
ok , i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
i hate working on christmas eve ! whoa ! get a load of this guy ! come in central , i think we ’ ve got ourselves a situation here .

great play !
honey , the house is such a mess ! i need you to help me tidy up a bit . my boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless !

great ! can you set the table ?
bobby ! come here , look what i got you !
a chess board ! daddy is going to teach you how to play !
ok , each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ’ ll play with the black pieces . now in the front , you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .
see this one that looks like a tower ? it ’ s called the rook . the one with the tall hat is called the bishop . see this little horsey ? this is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .
that ’ s right ! that ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . if the other player captures your king , he will say ” check mate ” and the game is over ! doesn ’ t this sound fun ?
hurry up , get in .
ok , make a left here . . . no wait , i meant make a right . come on , speed up !
don ’ t worry about it , just drive . oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it !

ok . where do i go then ?
what do we need to get from the supermarket ?
we can buy a three liter bottle . it works out cheaper per liter . we should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .

we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . we can treat ourselves .
i ’ d like a few cans of coke . we also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .

she ’ s eight years old . she ’ s getting quite old . your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ?
i ’ m sure he would . we usually have to drag him home .
she spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . she ’ s very secretive . occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse .

i ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but i ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . could you give me some advice ?
i ’ m fairly busy , so i really need an animal that i don ’ t need to care of very much . actually , i ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . i don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . do you have any suggestions ?
not really . by the way , i don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
i like the red one . what do they eat ?
thanks a lot . what i ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
i think i should join a fitness centre . i am getting a little fat and i'm totally out of shape . even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath .
i smoke around 30 each day .
i'll join a fitness centre . i'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . there's one near my office , so i can go before and after work . i don't want to go jogging in the street , so i'll use a treadmill .
hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . what exercises are you going to do today ?
good idea . i'd suggest you do some crunches too . thery're great for getting in shape . make sure you do them correctly .
sure . is today only you second visit ?
the treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . you can increase that later .
what do we need for the barbecue ?
i can ’ t wait to start cooking ! i ’ ve bought the grill and charcoal . do you have enough plates and utensils ?
i brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . we ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce .
how long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ?
they can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it .
do you like cooking ?
i don ’ t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
how long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ?
which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
yes , we do . we also eat a lot of lamb .
that ’ s right . they tastes so good ! we eat them with mint sauce . have you every tried them ?

it ’ s a beautiful day here in new zealand at the men ’ s volleyball world championship . my name is rick fields and i ’ m joined by the man with the plan , bob copeland .
the ref signals the start of the game and here we go . ribero serves and china quickly receives the ball . chen bumps it to the setter , and . a very nice set by chen !
it ’ s china ’ s service now . what a superb jump serve by li , oh , and we have a let serve . the ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .
welcome back racing fans ! my name is rick fields and , as always , i am joined by my partner in crime , bob copeland .
he came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . we have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track .
smoke is coming out of his car ! he seems to be having engine trouble ! he makes his way into the pit , and fernando alonso takes the lead !
do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
no . i ’ m a little worried about security . you never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . aren ’ t you worry about that ?
so , how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . while you ’ re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting .
the bathroom looks lovely . did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
so , let ’ s see . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?
how long did it take you to do the tiling .
i think you ’ ve done a very good job . as least as good as a professional would do . perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
good morning . i ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . could you help me ?
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it ’ s on sale , isn't it ?
i ’ ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
it ’ s quite large . it ’ s about 40 square metres .
i have redecorated my bedroom . i decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . i also bought a new pair of curtains . what do you think of it ?
i bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . i also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .
do you think that i should get a new wardrobe ?
yes . i have some many clothes stuffed into it . perhaps i should get rid of some of them . there are clothes in there that i never wear anymore .
that ’ s a good idea . after i get rid of the old clothes i no longer wear , i can see what new clothes i need to buy .
i ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . i bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . what do you think of this ?
i ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe .
yes , it would . it ’ s very expensive though .
yes . i ’ m sure i could find something similar at one . i ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .
i like them very much . we also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds .
we eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant .
why is it relatively expensive ?
do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine .
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? i don ’ t think i can finish everything in time .
first of all , i need you to do the drying up . i ’ m almost finished the washing up . i ’ m going to clean the cooker when i finish .
we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . i made far too much food to eat alone . i am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
daisy ’ s in hospital too . she god food poisoning last week . she thinks she got it from some bad seafood .
i see . my niece just flew back from australia to visit . she ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .
oh , your hand is still sore . you should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling .
how do you use an atm card , billy ?
oh yes . i ’ ve got it written down here . just a minute .
ok , i ’ ve entered my pin . there are several options on the screen . i guess i just choose which service i want , don ’ t i ?
i can just enter the amount using the key , right ?
i ’ d like to send this parcel to australia .
sure . it ’ s not very heavy .
i see . what are the options ? i suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail .
it that case , i ’ ll send it by airmail . i ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel .
thanks very much . there ’ s thirteen dollars .
how can i help you ?
what ’ s your destination ?
oh , dear . what ’ s your last name , please ?
and your passport number ?
let me see . it doesn ’ t look like we have any information about your ticket here .
oh dear . i ’ m really sorry , sir . but you don ’ t have any proof of purchase . you ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket .
it depends on how you want to travel . if you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 rib , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100rmb .
looks like you might like the soft sleeper then .
. sir ?
perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket .
you ’ re just 4 mao short for the hard sleeper , but i ’ ll let it go . anything for love !
good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . may i help you ?

according to the map , we get off the m11 at the second junction and join the m25 . that ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of london .
then we drive west on the m25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction !
then we take the first heathrow airport . what ’ s the total distance ?
22 miles to the m25 , 33 miles on the m25 , and 3 after that . that ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ?

why ?
could it be the battery ?
well , i suppose it could be the gas .
excuse me , can you tell me the way to holton railway station ?

excuse me . i ’ m a stranger here and lost my way .

i ’ ve changed my mind .

who's coming ?
sorry . i didn't quite catch what you said . there's a lot of noise outside .

not really , no . we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street .
we'll need two bedrooms . the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .
how far away is it from the campus ?
that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision .
what if there's something wrong with it ?
are you sure ?
what kind of place shall we rent ?
absolutely . that's the most important thing to take into consideration . i'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
i like this apartment . do you think we can afford the mortgage ?
i love the balcony . we can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . we are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony .
yes , and there are many houses nearby . i like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks .
yes , it would . don ’ t worry . there ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . this place will be fine .
so , tell me about you new house . how is it different to your old one ?
so , it ’ s a three bedrooms detached house ?
what ’ s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
are the rooms nice and bright ?
do you have a balcony ?
you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? there can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
i don't know how to adjust my life . would you give me a piece of advice ?
yes , i can't sleep well every night .
i drink a lot of wine .
i often feel so tired .
i sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .
can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?
i need to excise my arms too . how can i do that ?
what ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?
so i need plenty of space for this exercise .
mum , can i finish my homework later ?
but i want to watch tv now .
please .
i can ’ t find my purse . have you seen it ?
no , i had it when i left school this afternoon .
yes , i ’ d better give her a call now .
let ’ s play a little game . i ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is .
ok . this man is tall and slim . he ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair .
yes , it is . you describe someone we both know .
is she attractive ? i don ’ t think i know anyone like that .
i like slim girls , so i doubt i would find a plump girl attractive . you ’ ll have to give me some more information .
how embarrassing ! i don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! how important do you think appearance is ?
i ’ m afraid you ’ re right . i chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality .
shall we have some soup first ?
ok , and what about the main course ? which would you rather have fish or meat ?
don't you like fish then ?
shall we have some white wine then ?
what would you like for dessert ?
fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ?
excuse me .
um , this steak , i asked for to be medium rare .
well , i ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . it ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . would you mind changing ?
you say he was around average hight .
weight ?
any marks on his face ?
glasses ?
long or short ? straight ? curly ?
boy , this surely doesn't help us much . it could be anybody . how about his cloth ? what was he wearing .
ok , now we are getting some where . pants ?
what kind of shoes ?
cow while boots .
all right . that nealy done a little .
there are so many record players here . that is hard to choose .
i'd rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound .
for today ?
we have a flight that we'll put you there at ten am . is that ok ?
i'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
are you ready to order ? may i suggest a veal ?
the chicken is also nice .
our special tonight is lobster .
perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
excuse me , sir ?
i'm afraid you can't smoke here .
it says ' no smoking ' .
you mustn't go to bed very late . can you be home before nine .
no . i won't let you ride a bicycle late at night .
how beautiful the flower is !
you like it . well , i'll gather in for you .
where it is ?
i wonder if you could help me , i'm looking for a room .
what sort of price are you asking ?
how do you spell your last name , mr . eakins .
1446 pine . that's in san francisco , isn't it ?
good morning ! may i help you ?
do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
very well . how long do you want the house ? all summer ?
i'm afraid i can only rent it for two months .
take care , peter . don't run so fast . are you tired ?
no , you mustn't sit on the grass . don't you see the notes ?
it says ' keep off the grass ! '
be careful . you can't smoke here .
may i come in ?
this seems a pretty nice room , i should say .
i see . i'd like to live here for about three years .
good morning , sir .
how do you want it , sir ?
how about your sideburns ?
exactly five dollars .
i made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock .
thank you .
yes , with the lux dandruff shampoo . it helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff .
i'd like a permanent wave . by the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? i ' ve been in this style for so long that i want a change this time .
i prefer this kind of style . can you make it for me ?
good morning . do i need an appointment ?
thank you .
i've been wearing my hair long for years , but now i'd like to try some kind of modern style . what do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ?
i hope so . i'm really tired of this old fashioned style that i've been wearing .
yes , if you think it will help .
it's great ! will it be hard to care for ?
good morning , sir .
do you have a particular style in mind ?
i think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
the changes are usually not that dramatic . we just got some pictures of the latest fashion . would you like to take a look ?
i would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool .
i think i would like the pants pleated . i am not sure about the jacket though as i'm a little overweight .
yes , that is why i usually choose dark colours for my business suits .
certainly .
i come to try my new suit . here's the receipt .
aren't the trousers a little too long ?
very well . thank you .
excuse me . would you please make a suit with this material ?
please don't make it too tight . this is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
the 10th ? i'm sorry , but you see i'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
miss , where do you want to go ?
no problem .
yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece .
where to , ma'am ?
the grand hotel ?
no , madam . i don't think i do .
where is that ?
are you in a hurry ?
we'll make it except a jam . you know it's rush hour .
i'll do my best .
do you have small bills ?
shall we share a taxi ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house .
yeah . if we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
can i help you , sir ?
oh , this way please . what size do you wear ?
how about this one ?
all right . i'll show you something darker . do you like this one ?

it's very considerate of you to do so . do you have any laundry today ?

i'm afraid i don't . i'm quite new in town .
no , i don't . but i do know where the shopping mall is .

our seafood is fresh . i recommend shrimp with garlic .
excuse me . i am looking for a book called little women , but i can't find it anywhere .
excuse me . when's the next bus ?
oh , good . that'll be the number forty four ?
so when's the next forty four ? will it be here soon ?
so when will it be here then ?

i want to go to broadway and 82nd street . can i take any bus that comes along ?
how often do the buses run ?
fine . how long does it take to get to 82nd street ?
yes , i am . i arrived only three days ago from japan .
i like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me .
thank you for the information .
excuse me . is this where i catch the bus for the zoo ?
that doesn't sound too bad .
where are you going , jane ?
i saw her yesterday . she was a little better .
no , you needn't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
how long will it take me to get there ?
that's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
hey . why did you take that money ? you are such a cheater ! i should send you to jail !
well you can ’ t just take the money . you have to ask the bank for money . and i ’ m the banker .
yes .
can you help me find a pan ?
i want a big pan .
yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much .
it's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking .
sure . wait , wait . does a lid come with this pan ?
what are you working on ?
what budget ?
how much money can you spend ?
why only $ 300 ?
for what ?
your budget is a good idea .
hi , did you call for an exterminator ?
what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . i ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it . unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days .
well , i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . is there anything particular that you have in mind ?
well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart shaped pendant . what is her favorite gemstone ?
don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure free shopping environment . that stone is an amethyst . we have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . take a look at this bracelet . it ’ s 18k rose gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . it ’ s a great statement piece .
we have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . you could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional . if you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe i can help you find something for her .
well sir , i believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !
i want to go try on these clothes .
i found some jeans , and a new blouse .
what do you think ?
what about the jeans ?
i don't think so either .
i'll just buy the shirt .
mom , i'm ready for school .
i don't have a fever , and i'm ready for my test .
i'm fine , mom . i feel so much better . i want to go to school . i'm missing out on all the fun .
how can i help you today ?
what would you like to return ?
was there something wrong with it ?
what isn't working on it ?
alright , do you have the receipt ?
yeah , i'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first i have to separate them into little piles .
great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank .
oh yeah , those are from my trip to london . i have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound .
can i borrow five bucks ?
i promise if you lend me five dollars today , i will repay you in full next week .
fine ! i can't believe you don't trust me .
i know why mr . fro didn't like our ad idea ! he doesn't know the first thing about coffee .
oh , johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . no , i want to thank you for keeping grandma busy .
i know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . so , thank you .
look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning .
it tastes funny . why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ?
i'm done . can i watch tv ?
uh ! i can't swallow them , mom !
do i have to take them ?
yuck !
i am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . i was wondering about the size .
why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ?
mom !
i'm playing with my new jump rope ! watch this !
but i feel better .
guess what , gilly ? i won both bids .
yeah . it was so easy and super fast , once i figured it out .
i should get the items within a week . but in the meantime i'm bidding on a digital video camera .
thirty u . s . dollars . and it's only been used for six months .
i'm not hungry , mom .
oh . i'm sweating already . it's so hot . i can feel it boiling ! can i get out yet ?
hello , mr . gao . we appreciate your letting us have the apartment .
the ad said rent was thirty thousand . that includes utilities and phone , i assume .
that's another one thousand six hundred ?
you bet it is . and we got four thousand for our car space ! awesome !
that's just what was running through my mind . moonlight and dancing .
come on baby , let's dance !
sorry to bother you so early . there's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but i thought i'd ask you first .
i thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . so why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details .
my latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month .
it still tastes fine , though .
so how long do you plan to live here ?
fine by me . do you know how to read this kind of contract ?
great . when in rome , you guys know what to do .
that's really convenient . we were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .
ann , stop bugging jess and help me order something new . lattes are so passe these days .
sounds a little weak .
sounds better , but i hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head .
any new ideas on the mr . fro case ? how can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ?
i could use one , too . i'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign .
balista , i'll have a frappuccino .
you and your fancy italian names .
i'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much .
this motor oil case is still really slippery .
sure , why not ? i think i want a chocolate chip cookie , too .
so what ?
then i'll have to borrow it .
why ? it's in mint condition !
you're going to re sell it on ebay taiwan ?
this is a very spacious apartment . it's forty pings , including the parking space . that's about one thousand four hundred square feet .
you never know when two might turn into three .
exactly , which is why a three bedroom is better . and look , there are two bathrooms .
oh , well . it was fun to be the winner . but . it's too big . i must be an extra small in the states .
look ! it's amazing . i can't wait to try it out !
so the apartment comes unfurnished ?
we have tons of furniture . what we need are air conditioners .
i'm in heaven ! a whirlpool dryer !
this is too good to be true .
yes . we've lived in taiwan for a while . i had a gas stove in the states , too .
they're here ! now that's speedy service ! and they arrived within two days of each other !
wow . this shirt is nice , but looks big .
with the shipping included seventy dollars .
but this place doesn't feel like a forty ping apartment .
oh ! the view is great ! mountains , fresh air ! stars ?
and we could get a dog !
great . my favorite soup , soup , soup .
blow my nose ?
no , please , mom ! don't make me gargle with saltwater !
see ? that wasn't so bad .
it might be sore for a while . you'll be ok . now let's go home and rest .
no , sweetie . i'll make you some tomato soup and rice .
and vegetables with porridge .
oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem .
your upstairs neighbors live in canada and rarely come back to taiwan . when they do , they're never home .
no , i'm fine . i don't need to see a doctor .
ok . i'll go see the doctor .
chicken soup again ?
come to think of it , you should get out your english books and catch up on your reading assignments .
this is awful ! it's like drinking saltwater ! it's like drowning in the ocean !
ok , ok .
maybe i'll run away first .
johnny , are you just sitting around again ?
your best isn't good enough . back in my day , i'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty !
you're darn toomin ' , you know ! now , you're on housework duty while i'm here !
you're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !
and you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !
steve , thanks for looking after johnny .
and this kitchen is so clean . did you help johnny with that ?
that's great . and the garbage , too ?
i think i found my yankee's mug .
it fell out of the garbage bag .
it was with all the other dishes from dinner .
no . i'd like tea . can you put it in my favorite cup ? you probably washed it .
grand theft auto three is awesome !
what time is it anyway ?
oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done !
ok , emergency measures . let's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone .
she was the head janitor at st . mary's hospital for thirty years , after all .
you know , maybe she's just a neat freak .
so can we play playstation later ?
all my games are so lame , mom . when can i get a new one ?
right on . i'm gonna get a new game !
i knew there would be a catch !
that sounds great ! i am craving some type of beef dish .
i see , so what are we having ? chicken ?
sounds good ! i have always heard that indian spices give a rich flavor to food .
what about veggies ?
egg , this bathroom is a pigsty !
i just can't stand it . it's really gross in here ! there ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . so i cleaned it !
i can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here !
hang on . i'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor .
well , this is my first paycheck here in the states and there are a few things i don't understand . first of all , what is this fica , and sui y tax , and why are there deductions both for medicare and for my health insurance plan ?
then here we have a series of deductions . first off are the federal ones . fica stands for federal insurance contribution act , or something like that . it's your federal income tax . and then there's social security and medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work .
that's right . not all states have an income tax . some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead .
no problem ! all those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . i can understand why you'd want some explanation .
hello sir , welcome to pistolera restaurant . may i take your order ?
i ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . may i suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos .
of course sir . our nachos come with melted cheese and chili .
hi , i would like to return this tv .
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
i spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
hey , trev ! how did the shopping go ?
trev , are you ok ?
aren't you lucky . the vintage clock guy is driving a hard bargain . so i have nothing .
hey julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?
i really feel like having a big juicy steak !
i didn't know you were a vegetarian !
a what ?
wow ! that's interesting ! it must be tough !
i found it at a garage sale once .
well , because i like you . ninety bucks .
sixty bucks ? no can do , son . you'll be lucky if i go down to eighty five .
johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ?
do i have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ?
yes , so this place had better be clean . you know grandma .
this is one of my favorite items .
how much for these autographed elvis records ?
uh , i'm not sure . are these all in good condition ?
i don't really need five .
hello . do you like this jewelry ? i made most of these items myself .
i've been making these designs for over ten years . you can have a bracelet for ten dollars .
why didn't you text me last night ?
i didn't get any of them . i was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and i never got your message .
i'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight .
very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
lastly , may i please know what name i should make the reservation under ?
i'm hungry , let's order up something to eat .
i was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae .
well i never seem to gain weight so i don't mind .
ok , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ?
ok , so the first thing we are going to do is pre heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees fahrenheit .
no we are gonna make the batter . take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing .
go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . i'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients .
we can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan .
hey honey ! where were you ?
how was it ? were there a lot of kids ?
what ? leftovers of what and from when ?
isn't that dangerous though ? i mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re heated ?
well ok , i am just afraid of getting food poisoning .
thank you for coming tonight , mrs . webber . as a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent teacher conference night .
well allen is a great student . he is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math .
well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . i would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . it will really help a lot .
um . yes . here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's tumion is overdue .
sure . would you like to have the loaf sliced ?
will that be all ?
can you help me set up my voicemail message ? i just got this service and i am not really sure what i am supposed to say .
ok , so can i say , this is abby's voicemail . i will call you later , so leave me your name and number .
ok , so how about this , this is abby and i am really happy you called ! i promise i will give you a ring as soon as i can , so please leave me your name and number . talk to you soon ! .
look , jimmy's report came today .
he's in the third grade sam ! you see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . a one means his achievement or work is excellent . here in science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory .
he got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . we should work on that with him .
what did you cook ?
great idea ! as long as i don't get food poisoning ! so what is on the menu tonight ?
this is delicious ! the ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste !
this is delicious ! the combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! i could have this everyday !
wow , this is great ! i never knew thai food was so creative and delicious !
what are you doing this weekend ?
is it a family thing or just friends ?
is your great uncle rick going to be there ? he is really funny .
you mean your sister ?
you lost me .
hello mrs parker , how have you been ?
well , i can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks i can administer the rest .
have you seen this news article ? apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online .
cool ! also amongst the winners is petra , in jordan , mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico .
well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages .
i will bring it up over sunday brunch .
good afternoon sir , may i please see your passport and reservation ?
i'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems .
we apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . if your flight is urgent , i can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight .
well , if you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning .
what's wrong ?
you should get acupuncture treatment . my mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her .
the needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . now there are high tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . however , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options .
this only signifies that the toxins have left the body . actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . once it's over you feel very comfortable .
this is the only way to get at the problem . anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it .
hello there , welcome to wine world . let me know if i can help you out at all .
hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course .
no , i don't think so . sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . you need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish .
yes , chardonnay is a white wine , but i'm not sure it'd be your best bet . chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . i'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this sauvignon blanc from new zealand .
that's another varietal , or type of grape , just like chardonnay .
it's ok , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . we don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but . this rhone valley white would be lovely .
well , this is a french wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . the french believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . this wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly viognier , i'd guess .
yes , this is one of our best sellers . it's not quite as dry as the sauvignon blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . it's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma .
whoa ! this is a massive flea market !
and hundreds of booths all filled with different kinds of stuff .
you can't buy much more , wei ! you already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to taiwan .
you want to go get a facial with me today ?
not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . there is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good .
well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . then i get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks .
well you should come with me one day , i'm sure you'll love it .
wei ! this is a first you didn't bargain !
f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done .
come on ! you can go tomorrow , just skip it today . it's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !
that's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ?
of course ! of course ! here you are . thank you so much .
um , let me see . hmm . this antique tea set here is gorgeous .
really ? no , no , i couldn't ! you're too nice !
good morning , young lady . you can call me ma . do you see anything you like ?
that quilt was passed down to me from my ma in holland .
ok . do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ?
like that rastafarian over there ? you mean dreadlocks ? you crazy ! that'll take way too long .
i'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like halle .
good evening ms . jackson . fancy meeting ’ you here .
clyde smith . pleasure to meet you . may i treat you ladies to dinner ?
you weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? well , my creole ancestors never ate that stuff . we have refined french tastes .
an ethiopian restaurant ? whoa ! i always think of starving people in ethiopia .
that's so ironic ! well , what's it like ? is it your traditional food ?
watsup , ladies ! y'll looking ’ fine tonight . may i have this dance ?
it's all good . i'll show you all the right moves . my name's malik .
how you feeling ’ , vista ? mind if i take your friend ' round the dance floor ?
black . classic .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed toe shoe .
i don ’ t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly . i don ’ t want bows . i find slingbacks very uncomfortable . those might as well be stilettos . too modern . ah , finally , this is what i ’ m looking for .
hmmm . not good . they ’ re too tight . the length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . and there ’ d be no room for my insoles . you know what ? i don ’ t think i have the patience for this today . they just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . i ’ ll come back another time .
how much are you selling it for ?
that's too expensive for me .
you can't go down on the price .
i'll buy it for $ 2000 .
i ’ ve decided to grow my own garden !
on the contrary , i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
well , first i need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools .

i ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
i'm planning on going to the market soon .
i don't know what we need .
i'll make a list .
okay , do we need any meat ?
what else do we need ?

we have been over this a hundred times ! we are not getting a pet !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .

stephanie ! did you just get to school ? but you were up and about when i left the dorm this morning ! that was about an hour and a half ago . this happens all the time ! why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ?
please explain because it makes no sense to me . how can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? you get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . half an hour , tops .
true , i hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?

welcome to al ’ s garage . what seems to be the problem ?
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
first of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .

it ’ s okay sir , calm down . what happened ?
ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus .
no , your computer might have a virus , i mean , it has a bad program on it . maybe that ’ s why it crashed . i recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or trojans .

alright , come here and lay flat on your back . let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . we must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .
madam i ’ m not trying to kiss you ! i am trying to demonstrate how to apply cpr in the case of an emergency .
as i was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . to do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .

he's probably a pervert . just ignore him .

now he's looking over here ! he's coming !
the road ahead is blocked . there might have been an accident .
not really , but they are on the rise .
look ! allen has the mike !
that was before he heard stanley sing ! i guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! allen has a really good voice ! he sounds like enrique iglesias !
hi , again . can i get you some more fruit ?
ok . i'll go then .
is stanley still singing that elvis song ? he's really hogging the mike !
he sounds like a sick cow !
i already tried that . nothing seems to help .
hey ! what happened ? ! my song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .
you cancelled the song , didn't you , jack ?
um , hello again . are you sure you don't want to make a purchase , sir ?
hush . ok . what is it ?
what kind of question is that ?
shut up . billy . billy !
wow ! what's that ?
it's so small that i didn't notice it .
here ! here ! use my card !
not on my life ! i'm the best man , so i pay !
what's that ?
uh . that's greek to me .
well , mine are baggy . they're the kind of pants you can lounge around in .
oh . i just wanted you to shut up . you were off key anyway . let me see that !
so what did you get ?
what's this ? essential oil ? wow ! this stuff is expensive .
how is oil supposed to make you relax ?
besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine .
just the necessities
no , but you never know when you'll need a flashlight .
when you smell them , they affect your nervous system .
you can do that , too . both methods have a healing effect .
ha ha . i'm just fatigued . and tomorrow is a big day .
gross ! what are you doing to yourself ?
it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball !
that way they look longer .
putting on mascara .
what are you doing ? checking the to do list for the wedding ?
so let's start by checking off what we've already done .
not yet , i was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the net .
no . there's makeup remover for waterproof mascara .
yep . see how long and curly my lashes are ?
there's so much to do and so little time .
yes . we're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium !
all set . and we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted .
hey ! ask your mom for more old pictures , ok ?
but we saved your parents so much money .
what's in the box ?
what do you mean ?
how sweet ! maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !
who wants to go first ? allen ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ?
well , usually people think i'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say i sound a lot better !
here we are , ryan ! this is where we're going to celebrate !
you won't need it . stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody !
if it were up to stanley , we'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
so your mom can stop nagging you now .
don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune teller again .
the day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day .
i'll have whatever you're having .
hello ! i'm sorry to bother you . this is a complimentary fruit tray . your food will be ready soon .
actually , uh , i made it myself .
tie a yellow ribbon on the old oak tree ? ! where did you learn that song ?
hello again ! here's another fruit tray for you .
i make each one a little different . it's a way for me to express my creativity !
oh , look at your table ! i'll help you clear it off .
taylor , you're looking a little pale . are you sure you want to hand out nametags ?
true . keep up the good work . hello , welcome to the reunion of the class of ' 93 .
and don't forget to put in an order for your reunion memory book .
did you like the chanel bag that i got ?
i bought it on ebay . it was only one tenth of the original price . and the purchase was so easy .
well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . but auctioning on ebay is risky .
hit ' em high , hit ' em low . class of ' 93 — let's go !
wasn't that football game great ! i just knew we'd win !
later we'll let you know who the king and queen of the reunion will be .
holly ? holly madison , is that you ? you look great ! you haven't changed a bit .
it's me . the d man ! i sat behind you in english . are you and taylor still dating ?
well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could .
ten dollars ? maybe there are a lot of them .
was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ?
some people get nasty on those comments . maybe you should write him and ask nicely .
only one . but i wanted to make sure i'd get it .
oh . i'm such a newbie . but at least i'm sure i'll get that tennis racket .
so , got any more ideas for the website ?
but we registered at macy's . people can just buy gifts there .
you're right . they can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things .
any other ideas ?
and we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures .
i decided to give it a go !
a deny shirt and one of serena williams ' used tennis rackets !
yep . i placed a bid for the shirt . the minimum was ten so i bet fifty !
well , there was a sign that said “ buy now for seventy . ”
it seems that you can e mail the seller and ask questions .
and people are honest ?
i understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but i am willing to pay extra for shipping .
thanks so much ! by the way , is the racket really serena williams ’ ?
brooke , i have bad news .
i called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today .
i'm sorry . i didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats .
they said that they did . i've been so busy .
i didn't think there would be a problem .
i'm sorry . we're still going . i got reservations for all of us on the 31st . it will be ok . trust me .
ok . i just saw a versace for thirty dollars . this stuff can't be real !
i'm not sure i'd want to give these people my credit card number .
sure , but it's so complicated . they asked for my credit card authorization number .
merry christmas , sweetie . how's your brother enjoying taiwan ?
no ! christmas without him is bad enough . so , honey , do you have cold feet yet ?
you're not coming ?
i'm afraid not . the church is booked until the year 2001 .

uh . , i'm not even married yet . how about this brown dried fruit ?
and how about these little brown chips ?
i bought it . i got a watch , too . the company that sells this car has a car club .
yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car !
i know girls love this kind of car . look , it's got a sunroof ! imagine . a cool , starry night .

what kind of car is best for me ?
the compact ? why do you think that one is better than the others ?
that's true . what kind of safety features are we talking about ?
you mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ?
i think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . what ’ s worse , i just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts i have been paying for . last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . you know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . i was just wondering about all these .

it sounds so complicated !
this website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . it is quick and accurate .
so it has attracted more and more customers these days .
the air conditioning is not working ! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it ’ s really annoying !
want to send out for some chinese ?
okay . i could go for that . it ’ s called al ’ s steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like .
yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i can ’ t finish what i ’ ve ordered .
excuse me .
i would like to return this item . are refunds allowed ?
no , no . it was just the wrong size .
yeah , right here .
no , thank you .
it's my first visit to prague , i'll be here for three days for a conference , then i have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before i head back home . what do you suggest i see when i'm here ?
the subway ? but is there a subway station next to my hotel ? i have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day .
is it expensive to ride on the underground ?
is it easy to get lost ?
so how ’ s everything going for christmas ?
what ’ s that ? don ’ t tell me you ’ ve still got christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours .
he still doesn ’ t know that santa isn ’ t real ? how old is he , eight ?
you think it ’ s better that he should be told ?
that happened to my oldest girl . she became really upset when her classmates told her santa wasn ’ t real .
ok , honey , time to take down the christmas tree .
come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
a good atmosphere ? the tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .
but christmas was two weeks ago ! it ’ s been there only because we ’ ve been too busy to get rid of it .
but it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
yeah , it was a good christmas . it won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .
how do you like this one ? it's nice and cheap it's only thirty four dollars .
sorry . i think that's the cheapest
yes . you can the fitting room is right over there .
do you know the circulation of this magazine ?
oh , yes , how's it ?
i don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . he says painful words everyday .
he says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy very quickly if i do something that he doesn ’ t like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
it ’ s easy to say , but i will try .
paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . so , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ?
my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now .

i know , but another pair can ’ t hurt .
do you take in students ? i've been told you might have a vacant room .
how much are you asking ?
could i have a look at it , please ?
we need to figure out how much money we ’ re spending and what we ’ re spending it on .
well , i think we could be saving more .
let ’ s see . we spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month .
we put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account .
what sort of shopping is nearby , mr . taylor ?
what about things other than food ?
are there small shops near here as well ?
well , that sounds just wonderful .
well , our store offers a 90 day return policy and the manufacturer offers a one year warranty on any factory defects .

i'd like to . see you tomorrow .
i'm calling to ask about your apartment you advertised .
that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to downtown , as i spend most of my time at the office .
i'm sure they are wonderful , but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost .
great ! i'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed dress ?
a friend told me might find a room here .
what do you charge ?
ok . would it be all right to look at the room first ?

twice a week for work and once for shopping .
tommy played truant today . his teacher called me this morning .
i've asked him , but he won't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes .
stop , stop . we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school .
in that way , i'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ?
jason , where have you been hiding lately ? you know it's been a long time since your last call . have you been good ?
i am fine . what have you been doing ?
that's great , congratulations !
that's good . so i guess i'll have to make an appointment to see you .
how long have you been working there ?
how do you like your new boss ?
much better than the last one , huh ?
forget about him . come over to my house tonight . let's get drunk .
8 it is . see you then .
excuse me , could you help me ?
well . i was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ?
i think so . i can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and i remember the last place i used it yesterday was in this department store .
in the shoe department . i had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques .
then what shall i do ?
you are right . do you have a pen ?
my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road .
can i see the doctor ?
no , i don't .
well , i am spending my vacation here and i have a stomachache and .
i ’ d prefer to see him asap . if i have to wait for another 30 mins , i think i will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and .
no , not for this country .
no , i didn't think i ’ d need it .
cash , credit card , cheque anything . i just have to see a doctor . i am in pain .
how do i set up an e mail account ?
which link ?
oh , no . what did i do ? it's asking me for a password .
yes .
oh , i see .
hi , excuse me . i am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the royal hotel is ?
well , i seem to be a little bit lost here . i am worried that i ’ ll never find my way . what's worse . i forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now .
i am trying to get to the royal hotel . do you know where that is ?
great . are there any landmarks nearby ?
oh , that's good . i should be able to find it pretty easily then . is that far from here ?
oh , that will take too long and i am kind of in a hurry . can i take a bus there ?
all right . i guess i'll take a taxi then . how long will it take by taxi ?
look , jim . that man just fell down over there .
sir , sir , are you all right , sir ?
oh , no . he is not breathing and there ’ s no pulse . call 911 .
excuse me , sir . you can't park here .
sir , the curb here is not for parking .
there is a sign at the corner of the street . when you turned in here , you should have seen it .
my watch always gains ten minutes a day .
no kidding .
you know what you can do ?
no , you don't have to . you only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day .
good afternoon , sir . please sit here .
how would you like your hair cut , sir ?
very well , sir . do you want me to trim your beard ?
now have a look , please . is it all right ?
do you want conditioner ?
yes , sir .
it's been a long time , mrs , lee .
when did you come back ? did you have a good time ?
i will . how would you like your hair today ? the same style as usual ?
that's true . here are some samples of hairstyles . what do you think about this one ?
very well . you aren't in a hurry , are you ?
ok . the manicurist will be right here .
hello , is this apartment management ?
yes , this is the tenant of apartment ten . i guess my kitchen sink is clogging up again , and so is the bathtub .
um , i'd really appreciate it if you send someone over to fix it today . it's really a bother . i can't cook or take a shower .
let me take a look . you know why ? it's clogged with hair . no wonder water won't go down .
you ’ re darn right !
don't worry . i ’ ve got some acid here . it will help dissolve the hair down there .
i guess not , huh .
you should have moved out long , long ago .
so how can you stand the heat ?
gosh ! the water faucet is dripping badly again .
i wish i could , but i ’ ve got to go now . i have an appointment in 20 minutes .
oh , by the way , could you give me a ride ? my car is still in the garage .
excuse me . i've been waiting here for 15 mins . do you know how often does no . 3 run ?
it seems that you have got here at a good time . do you have a bus schedule ?
taxi .
thank you . pls hurry , i am late . can i get to the battery park before 4 ?
how exactly do you figure out the car fare ?
oh , i see .
thank you . how much do i owe you ?
that's 20 dollars . keep the change !
oh , my goodness . the traffic is crawling .
we are now running late .
let me check and look at the map . yes , there is an exit three quarters of a mile ahead . we ’ ll exit market street , head west , then get on the pennsylvania freeway .
fill it up , pls .
premium , pls . could you check my tyres , too ? i think they need air .
i don't think so . it's brand new .
yes , pls . i also need you to check the oil and the radiator .
pls fill it up with water then .
do you take credit card ?
30 dollars and 10 cents ? here you go .
can you do me a favor ?
can you keep an eye on my bag , please ? nature's calling .
no , i just want to use the bathroom .
can you lend me some money ?
you ’ ve gone through all your money so quickly ? i thought you were well off .
ok , so where do you think we can save more money ?
yeah . that ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . what about the books ?
come on . if we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy .
ok . let's compromise . if you agree to only spend 75 on books , i'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt .
we need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ?
let's see . we spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month .
we put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account .
where is my back pack ?
i just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone .
of course , i am sure . i bet someone stole it .
ten sheets of rice paper , 25 brushes , two boxes of oil color and two boxes of water color . all these come up to $ 35 . 50 , sir .
sure , just a minute . are you an artist , sir ?
that must be a very interesting job .
do you ? nice to meet you ! and here is the invoice and your change .
can we have a table for three , please ?
do you have a table for four , please ?
what color and what style do you like ?
good morning , sir . may i help you ?
what do they look like ?
how tall are they ?
do they look like roses ?
oh , lilies of the valley . no , i am sorry . we are all out of them right now .
what about roses ?
as many as you like , sir . they are beautiful , aren't they ?
please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . please roll down your window .
have you been drinking ?
really ? but i can smell alcohol on your breath . blow to the breathalyzer , please .
your bac exceeds legal limit .
i'll have to write you a ticket and impound your vehicle .
good afternoon , madam . may i help you ?
i am sorry , madam . i didn't hear you . it's too noisy here . could you please say it again ?
here you are .
yes , certainly , madam .
yes , it is . this perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of chanel .
thank you . do you need something else ?
well , yes , we are , madam . the shop shuts down in five minutes .
last week , madam ? i really can't remember which ones you mean . what were they like ?
that's strange . i don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . are you sure they were in this shop ?
i am afraid the sales are over now , madam . and you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
well , it's all new stock in the window now .
eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . and there are still one or two things at the sale price .
hi , waiting for the bus ? where are you going ?
why don't you take a taxi ? it'll get you there much faster .
could you do me a favor ?
could you run over to the store ? we need a few things .
well , could you pick up some sugar ?
a small bag . i guess we also need a few oranges .
yes . we're out of milk .
no . i think a half gallon will be enough .
i think so . have you got all that ?
do you have enough money ?
excuse me . could you help me ?
i'm looking for a leather belt for my husband .
size 36 . . . i think .
dark brown , if you have it .
yes . i'm sure he will . i'll take it .
do you take master card ?
this is bob . where have you been , mary ? i have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . don ’ t you leave your home at 7
i arrived this morning . i would have rung you before but i have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . it has only just ended . are you doing anything tonight , mary ?
but that is terrible ! i am only here for one night !
i didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference .
yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . so i am doing it instead . mary , must you go out tonight ? couldn ’ t you get out of it ?
no , i will stay another day . my boss will get over it . would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ?
it is all right . i will call the boss and tell him i am staying another day . i stayed an extra night in boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it .
i will tell you tomorrow . see you tomorrow , mary .
my goodness ! what a busy line so early in the morning ! hello .
hi , basil .
yes , by all means . i was just about to leave .
i'll wait on the sidewalk . it's very kind of you .
hi , basil .
do you mind if i take some notes while we drive ?
yes , i finally have an inspiration .
are you ready to order ?
would you like fries with that ?
is this dine in or take out ?
listen , karen , i need your help . i don't know anyone here yet .
my mother in law just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight .
doctors aren't sure yet . but the real problem is suzy . she has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . but we don't know who can stay with her .
yes , i'd ask jill , the girl i've had before , but i need someone overnight . maybe even for two nights .
i don't want to do that to you , karen .
i'd like to talk with her . this is short notice , i know . but hank and i are leaving tonight .
i'm glad you know someone . i knew you would be the best person to ask about this . i don't want to insult jill or her mother . i think jill maybe could do it . but i'd rather have someone a little older .
um , i ’ m just having a look around . it ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . i'm trying to find her something .
sure that ’ s fine . this is so awkward . what ones do i pick ? what size is she ?
just pick something and get the hell out of here . um , i'll go with these two . this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with . she better thank me for this .
finally !
welcome to al ’ s garage . what seems to be the problem ?
very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ?
we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .
first of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves .
what do we need to get from the supermarket ?
a crate of beer ? why do we need that ?
i think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . we can treat ourselves .
i ’ d like a few cans of coke . we also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ?
ok , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . i think i saw a promotion for pastrami . also get s
never mind that . get some dips as well . get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some tzatziki . if they have bean dip get that as well . last but not least , get some pickles .
welcome to the national post . how may i help you ?
very well . you will need some stamps for the postcards and i need to weigh that package .
well , it depends . do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ?
well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online .
have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ?
i ’ m having the same problem . i want to get something really special . jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts .
he bought me an iron .
maybe not , but my iron was getting old . in fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . it ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working !
honey , can you set the table ?
well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . i don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case .
honey ? have you seen our soup bowls ?
in china at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well to do bourgeois lifestyle . coffee is often considered a hobby of the well educated , middle class people .
well . tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . people visit tea
i'm afraid he's not in at the moment dave . he went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .
all right . goodbye , dave .
pardon me . could you please pass me the tissue ?
yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , i haven't had the need or the opportunity . every time i try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes .
yeah , i guess that's a typical example of when in rome , do as the romans do .
my lease ends next month , so i have to find a new place .
do you know any places ?
thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
i can only afford about 1 , 000 yuan a month .
it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
i want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
why ? will those be students who are leaving ?
thank you . i'll be sure to take a look .
may i see a hat , please ?
yes , i like this one . it goes very well with my coat . how much is it ?
that was a really good meal , gordon .
well , it is getting pretty late . i think we should go home .
let's see how much the bill is .
what are you talking about ? we'll split the bill .
no way , gordon . i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . there's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
that's better . this way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
you've got a deal .
hey , robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . where did you get it ?
true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to china for the first time .
yeah , i have the same feeling . also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . things in a department store are usually quality guaranteed . but at a wholesale market , you never know whether w
oh , sam ! is this your dog ?
yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small .
not at all . they're quiet most of the time . but they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs .
yes . it was starving and looking for something to eat when i saw it .
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china . it's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .
yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on open air fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just
oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! no wonder there are few people .
yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . you don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?
when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .
make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .
that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .
it's just the right size a perfect fit ! i'll take it . oh , no , i'm a little short . did you bring your credit card ?
can i get you something to drink ?
so how about an aperitif ?
stirred or shaken ?
here we go .
enjoy yourself .
i'm going to the hospital to see susan green .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
thank you , henry . i'll get a number 13 .
my mp3 player is broken , so i want to change it for an mp4 player . can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?
oh , that's a good idea . perhaps i should have a try .
yeah , if i buy a cell phone like this , i don't have to take a music player everywhere i go , and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .
256mb .
hi , sam . i want to buy a pet . do you have any ideas ?
why ? anything special there ?
that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out .
why not ? it's so cool .
pardon ?
well , i didn't realize that .
oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .

do you think children watch too much tv ?
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don ’ t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
they could go out and play with their friends .
perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too .
do you use an anti virus program to protect your computer ?
how often do you run your anti virus program ?
which anti virus program would you recommend ?
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?

hello , sir , what can i do for you today ?
no problem ! we have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .
very well sir . would you like to have some shirts made also ?
hi ! i see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
when you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do , you might get a lot of spam unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .
that ’ s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time
take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it , you will
how often do you use the internet ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
yes , i like the job though . sometimes , i help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .
i think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . first , a lot of the information you find online is false . second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .

here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?

you're finally here ! what took so long ?
it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
it would be better for the environment , too .
well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
so , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
i ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat .
will you take long ?

yes , the fitting room is over there , it looks fantastic on you , this style color in sizes natural here and figure , perfectly .

yeah , my friend is getting married next month and i ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . i have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but i haven ’ t lost any weight ! look at these love handles .
why ? if i eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?
so you are saying that i should eat , but i should just watch what i eat ?
if i do all this do you think i can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?
it ’ s freezing in here ! can i turn up the heat ?
dad ! are you serious ? what ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! look , i can see my breath !
dad ! i ’ m gonna catch a cold !
thank god you are open ! i have an emergency !
i need this dress and this suit dry cleaned asap !
no , you don ’ t understand , i need this tomorrow morning ! i accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! she ’ s gonna kill me !
fine ! can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
welcome to bill ’ s fabric world . what can i do for you today ?
sure we do ! we have the best tailors in the country ! what is it that you need exactly ?
excellent ! we have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices . how about we get you measured ? let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here .
no problem ! now for your pants , let me just measure your waist and the inseam .

we have been through this a million times ! let ’ s get going already ! i ’ m ready !
i ’ m doing it ! i ’ m driving ! this is awesome ! let ’ s turn some music on !

hello , ma ’ am , can i help you find something ?
we ’ ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point and shoot , or something a little fancier ? are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?
ah , well then i ’ d recommend a nice entry level digital slr .

oh , ah , um the nikon d60 is a nice option .
oh , well this one has the , uh .

polarizing filter um we should ! i ’ m sorry , ma ’ am . it looks like we ’ re sold out .
oh , well , would you look at that ! polarizing filters .
hi . what can i get for you ?
good choice ! our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what i mean .

okay , is there anything else ?
yes ! it ’ s very fine meat ! made it myself .
wait ! we have t bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . they are very fresh ! just came from the slaughter house .
hello sir , how may i help you ?
i see , may i ask what the occasion is ?
very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
mmm , well this is our i ’ m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
so can you fix it ?
what do you mean ? i bought this computer just three years ago !
i have no idea what you are talking about . i just want to know if it ’ s good and if i will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !
ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . i don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
since this is a white t shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
ah ! no ! damn it !
so what ? i just lost one hour's worth of work .
no , i didn't save this time . damn it ! and i'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i don't know . i feel like going out .
it doesn't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
yes , that's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper , and now i can't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
maybe we can trade . why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and i'll go drink beer ?
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
about fourteen .
welcome to galant . how can i help you ?
of course . we have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . the first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . this is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps .
lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . you are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! and we ’ ll throw in this pen drive !
good afternoon ! did you call for a plumber ?
i see . let me have a look . it seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . let me just get my plunger . no , that ’ s not working either . i suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . that ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .
yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .
yeah , i ’ ve just moved here , and i ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and i ’ m not sure if i should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan .
what ? really ? i don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone .
so what does this plan include ?
wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?
do you know what time it is ?
get in this door young man . it ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew .
i don ’ t care ! you are grounded for life , mister !
you know the rules and you broke them . no allowance and no tv for a week . i usually never ground you but this time i have to put my foot down !
hi , did you call for an exterminator ?
what sort of pest are we dealing with ?
well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . i ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . we will have to cover the entire house and fu
good morning , angela , how have you been lately ?
well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown . coffee ?
haha , i could never do that . i ’ d be a zombie if i didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . let ’ s get down to business then .
show me some classic high heels , please .
black . classic .
umm . too shiny . and i wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed toe shoe .
i don ’ t like the pointed toes . let me take a look at what else you have . too high . that one looks like the back would cut into my heel . i have a high instep so i doubt that one will fit properly .
seven and a half .
hmmm . not good . they ’ re too tight . the length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . and there ’ d be no room for my insoles . you know what ? i don ’ t think i have the patience fo
we have been over this a hundred times ! we are not getting a pet !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
we ’ re planning on having children soon , i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
i ’ ll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ?
nice ! brunch !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
you know , the basics . a rake , shovel , spade and a hoe .
good afternoon , ma ’ am , my name is mike and i am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals .
please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , i am sure we could find something that interests you !
we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! this one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world !
you mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters !
hey mel ! are you up for some tennis today ?
you sound exhausted . maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! she can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities . she can also help you do some household chores , and run so
i think you should definitely consider it ! this way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . i can refer you this great
oh great ! this stupid computer froze again ! that's the third time today ! hey samuel , can you come take a look at my pc ? it's acting again . it must have a virus or something .
well , it's true i've never driven two hours just to get lunch . but really , i think it's worth it .
how do you mean suffer ?
and even if it takes two hours , huh ?
well , this really is delicious , i have to admit . i can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining .
i know . i can see that . this is what is called dim sum , right ?
so when you chinese think of chinatown , you mostly think of food . is that right ?
and maybe we can go to a good italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . chicago has some great italian restaurants .
what do you mean ?
alright , alright . i am happy to try more chinese food . will it be dim sum again ?
taiwanese style ? isn't dim sum taiwanese style ?
i wonder if you can cook things this good .
why don't you watch where you're going ?
there was plenty of room for me to pull out . you didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
listen , let's just wait until the police get here . then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
i have a cell phone in my car . now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don't you get it for me , and then i can call the police ?
damn it ! i'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police .
it really hurts .
to hell with you . the accident was your fault .
excuse me .
yes , but . well .
how do i use the machines ?
no . i don't have soap .
thanks . okay . i have my soap .
i don't know . i want my clothes to be clean .
oh . i guess i didn't know . i have never washed clothes before .
yes .
i'm nineteen .
my mother always did it .
i know about this fact . american children are more independent . they do more for themselves . but i am from taiwan . in taiwan , children must study very hard . so the mother does everything for the kids . the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school . so i've never washed clothes before . you shouldn't laugh at me for it .
what ?
i don't know . it's hard . but i have to learn .
thanks . my name's nick .
this can ’ t wait ! i need your help now !
ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . i'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight . you can sweep and mop the floors . oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted .
sure that ’ s fine . here is the list of all the things you need to get . don't forget anything ! and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?
great ! can you set the table ?
dad , i ’ d like to borrow some money .
come on , dad , i need thirty thousand . i wanna get into the market . you know , i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . i look at this as an opportunity . this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example . they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
wow , you ’ re up early today ! what ’ s for breakfast ?
smells good ! i ’ ll make some coffee . do you want me to make you some eggs ?
www , i don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! ever since i was small , i ’ ve had eggs and soldiers .
here you go , honey , fried eggs .
i really appreciate your driving me around .
it would be hard for just me to do it . i don't know the city at all .
this one sounds good . efficiency with view of the lake . utilities and parking included . newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 .
no , i guess not . but that's what i want , isn't it ? an efficiency .
how about this one ? downtown efficiency . furnished . what does furnished mean ?
furnished . parking included . $ 400 .
yes , but it's downtown . i would like to take look at this one .
this one . two male grad students seeking roommate . must be quiet . comfortable downtown apartment . does this mean i have to share a room with them ?
that sounds alright .
sounds good to me . i really appreciate your help on this .
well , we have a lot of models here . did you want to listen to cd's or cassettes or the radio ?
alright . there are several models you may want to look at . this kreng portable cassette player is very good .
it's a german company . this unit has auto reverse , recording capability , and an am / fm radio band . it also has a built in microphone .
really ? have you had an auto reverse break before ?
hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?
alright . well . we have many units without auto reverse . here is a good unit . very reliable . it has an am / fm band , built in microphone , recording capability , and no auto reverse .
this one sells for $ 39 . 99 .
of course .
fine . i think you'll be happy with it . it's a very good unit . very reliable . i'll go get you a new one in a box . i will be back in just a moment .
ah ! it hurts . don't touch it .
the shoulder .
it's not a cut . it's a gash ! it's bigger than a cut ! ah ! i need a doctor .
i'm bleeding too much .
yes . my bike has one under the seat . get it , quick !
wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . that will work as a tourniquet . after that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
no , forget that ! do the tourniquet first . i'm losing too much blood .
i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts !
hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
ok . i ’ ll take it .
do you have anything in the middle section ? i want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
hey daddy ! you look great today . i like your tie ! by the way , i was wondering can i &
i haven't even told you what it is yet !
do you think i could borrow the car ? i ’ m going to concert tonight .
egg ! i told you about it last week ! smelly toes is playing , and eric asked if i would go with him !
duh ! he's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! come on , dad ! please !
fine then ! would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?
good evening , pizza house . this is marty speaking . may i take your order ?
we have a two for one special on large pizzas . would you like a large pizza instead ?
great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
okay , thin crust . your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !
the air conditioning is not working ! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it ’ s really annoying !
hello . may i help you ?
that one is one hundred and fifty dollars .
that ’ s one hundred and forty .
this is an exclusive design by marco ! it ’ s a bargain at that price .
okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ?
okay , i can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . one hundred and ninety dollars for both .
my final price ! one hundred dollars for both ! that ’ s two for the price of one . that ’ s my last offer !
i think you made the right choice , coming to us . we have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from .
oh , is that so ? well , then . let me show you something she might like . it's on our back lot .
yes . beautiful , isn't it ?
well , sir . you said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport . now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it . but you could probably rent this porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars .
it's because our prices are so good . and this car has a lot of miles on it . but it's in nice shape , isn't it ?
i have a cell phone in my car . now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don't you get it for me , and then i can call the police ?
damn it ! i'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police .
to hell with you . the accident was your fault .
you're smart to buy it . at 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
san francisco ? no , sir . we only have this office here . you will have to return it here .
no , sir . that's only with the very big companies . i'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
do you still want the car , sir ?
it's a beautiful drive .
what are we going to do ? i can't get the car out of this ditch . i'm stuck !
i know . this is terrible . what can we do ? this snow doesn't stop falling !
i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half hour to go .
i don't know .
what do you mean ?
i have plenty of gas .
so what can we do ?
alright . that's a good idea .
days ?
oh , my god ! it's good we have food .
good afternoon , sir , is there anything i can help you with today ?
well , i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . is there anything particular that you have in mind ?
well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart shaped pendant . what is her favorite gemstone ?
don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure free shopping environment . that stone is an amethyst . we have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . take a look at this bracelet . it ’ s 18k rose gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . it ’ s a great statement piece .
we have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . you could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional . if you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe i can help you find something for her .
perhaps you could give her a ring ?
well sir , i believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !
ah ! no ! damn it !
so what ? i just lost one hour's worth of work .
no , i didn't save this time . damn it ! and i'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
i don't know . i feel like going out .
it doesn't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
thanks . i think i will try . where are you going ?
maybe we can trade . why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and i'll go drink beer ?
so ? you can go to the class for me . just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . why not ?
about fourteen .
mom , dad ! can you come to my room ? i think there is something under my bed !
mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?
may i have a look at that vase , please ?
oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
can you give me a hand with the dishes ?
thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening .
it looks delicious .
may i help you , sir ?
by air or by sea ?
this gift is the best for a man who has everything .
i'm concerned about your car .
but i think i can help to fix it .
can you mail this at the post office for me ? i have to go to the doctor for an appointment and i don't have enough time to go to the post office .
sir , would you like some dessert now ?
here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious .
i am afraid there is none .
i really want to go to china for vacation , but i can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket .
no , not yet . can you find a good price there ?
well , you don ’ t have to be mean . how do i do it ?
ben , what are you doing ?
why ?
have you thought about graduate school ?
would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
oh , no . we ’ re going to be late for the meeting .
oh , good .
well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . it ’ ll probably cost around six dollars .
i can ’ t find the business card . do you know the address ?
right .
hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?

i finally found an apartment that i want to rent .
i saw it in this ad for apartments in today ’ s newspaper .
i really did , but what ’ s so great about it is that it ’ s really affordable .
well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful .
the rent is $ 725 each month .
that ’ s what i said when i found out how much the rent was .
excuse me !
is this your handbag ?
is this your handbag ?
what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ?
i might get one too , but in a different color . i prefer light blue to white 。
i ’ m getting this beret ? doesn ’ t it look cool ? i ’ d like to get some jeans too , but i don ’ t have enough cash on me .
what do you think this flat ?
that's true , but i love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine .
it has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park .
may be we could get some new furniture , better stuff .
this apartment is wonderful .
how much would i have to pay for rent ?
how about if i pay $ 850 ?
i can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 .
you can ’ t go any lower than that ?
do you like cooking ?
i don ’ t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having it clean up after the meal . i can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
how long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
i ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please .
well , i thought that i would choose either this one or that one . i really want a dark blue suit . which do you recommend .
yes . i can feel the difference in material . there ’ s not much difference in price . ok , i ’ ll take the more expensive one .
that ’ s fine . i would also like a few shirts and a jacket . i don ’ t need them specially made . those shirts over there look very nice . are they made of cotton ?
may i speak to the apartment building manager , please ?
i was hoping that the apartment on main street was still available .
yes , it would be nice to see the apartment .
yes , i can be there at 6 .
i'm okay , thank you . i already checked out the address on mapquest .
is there anything that i need to bring with me ?
i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it's on sale , isn't it .
i ’ ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ?
it ’ s quite large . it ’ s about 40 square meters .
this house is not looking all that great from here
it is just too dark in here with so few windows .
the kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space .
how many dogs live in this house ?
it doesn ’ t look much better inside this place .
there are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy .
look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper .
what ’ s that smell ?
hi , can i speak with the apartment manager , please ?
i'm calling about the apartment for rent on main street .
i would love to see it .
yes , i will be able to make it then .
i used to live in that area .
how are you today ?
can i help you ?
i ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today .
you have to make an appointment first .
is this friday okay ?
yes , i will schedule you for that time .
did you need help with something ?
that won ’ t be possible today .
you can only view the apartment with an appointment .
are you available this friday ?
your appointment for friday at 6 pm has been confirmed .
could i speak to the apartment manager ?
i wanted to know if that apartment on main street is still for rent .
yes , i want to see it .
that time is okay with me .
no , thank you . i go by there on my way to work .
that's a good idea . do i need to bring anything myself ?
what are your thoughts on the apartment ?
there aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?
what problems ?
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
i ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
like what ?
those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in .
yes . now what other problems do you have ?
well , i ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking .
what can i do for you today ?
unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today .
you ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment .
how does this friday sound ?
that will be fine .
everything is okay ?
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
i assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
i ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
i would love to rent out your apartment .
how much is the rent ?
that ’ s a lot of money .
what about $ 800 ?
i can ’ t pay much more than that .
that would be fine .
i heard that you finished my home inspection , and i was wondering how it went .
i am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?
can i require the owners to fix the problems ?
what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
what would be the earliest that i could actually move into my new house ?
what should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ?
there are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning .
i asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in .
can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?
i never had a home inspection before .
i asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house .
i heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes .
what kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ?
what would be a good day to finally move into the house ?
will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ?
the carpet needs to be cleaned , and i want to paint the walls a different color .
i want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .
would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day i move in ?
hello , i was wondering if i could talk with the apartment manager .
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available .
yes , i have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .
ok , should i bring anything with me ?
i came in to see how my home inspection went .
i had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it .
are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ?
when can i move into my new house ?
i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .
i was thinking that i should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in .
can you help me on my move in day ?
so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? that refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?
that ’ s usual nowadays . you ’ ve added a few shelves too .
did you buy new cupboards too ?
i see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils .
i'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please .
yes , i would very much like to see it .
i have no problem with 6 p . m .
no , thanks . i already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like .
should i bring anything with me ?
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? i don ’ t think i can finish everything in time .
first of all , i need you to do the drying up . i ’ m almost finished the washing up . i ’ m going to clean the cooker when i finish .
we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . i made far too much food to eat alone . i am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
yes . look in that drawer . i should throw the old one out .
i ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . i bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . what do you think of this ?
i ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe .
yes , it would . it ’ s very expensive though .
yes . i ’ m sure i could find something similar at one . i ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom .
i have redecorated my bedroom . i decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . i also bought a new pair of curtains . what do you think of it ?
i bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . i also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .
do you think that i should get a new wardrobe ?
yes . i have so many clothes stuffed into it . perhaps i should get rid of some of them . there are clothes in there that i never wear anymore .
that ’ s a good idea . after i get rid of the old clothes i no longer wear , i can see what new clothes i need to buy .
the bathroom looks lovely . did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
how long did it take you to do the tiling .
which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ?
that ’ s right . they taste so good . we eat them with mint sauce . have you ever tried them ?
i certainly can . if i can get some from the butchers , i ’ ll cook them for you .
what do we need for the barbecue ?
i can ’ t wait to start cooking . i ’ ve bought the grill and charcoal . do you have enough plates and utensils ?
and if people drop them , they won ’ t break . we ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .
i brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . we ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce .
how long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ?
good morning . i understand that you ’ ve got a problem with your washing machine . i ’ m from the repair company .
is it still under warranty . if it is and i can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one .
ok . i ’ ll start by looking at the motor . i ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine . oh , yes . there ’ s the problem . it ’ s quite simple . i ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes .
hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . what would you like me to do ?
which spices are you going to add to the meat ?
yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons . of water . ok , i ’ m really to do the meat . should i cook it over a low flame ?
right . what are you doing over there ?
mom , i hate eating vegetables !
thanks , mom . can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake .
but i don ’ t like them . it ’ s not fair .
ok , actually i don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots . but i hate broccoli and cauliflower .
what would you like for dessert ?
i have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail .
of course . i made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh .
sure . can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator .
yes , i ’ ll have an ice tea . you see it next to the lemonade .
hey , jim . it's time to wake up and get out of bed .
you'd better get up , or you'll be late .
yes , it did . it went off thirty minutes ago . you slept right through it . you're like a dead person while you sleep .
rise and shine ! sleepyhead !
i think i may rent this apartment from you .
how much are you looking to rent it for ?
that is too expensive .
how does $ 850 a month sound to you ?
that ’ s the best that i can do .
would you please reconsider ?
i think i may rent this apartment from you .
that ’ s way too much .
i can afford about $ 800 a month for rent .
how much more are you thinking ?
that ’ s almost perfect .
can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?
is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
there are two of us , but we only need a one bedroom apartment .
i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
when you need an apartment , where do you look for one ?
can i share an apartment with someone ?
are apartments expensive in this city ?
i want a two bedroom apartment .

i would love to rent this apartment .
how much are you asking for every month ?
that is quite a lot of money for just one month .
what do you say to $ 850 a month ?
it ’ s either $ 850 or nothing at all .
could you please go lower ?
i found an apartment to rent .
i found it in today ’ s apartment ads .
i actually found it in the ads , and it ’ s not too expensive either .
all you really need to know is that the apartment looks great .
every month i ’ d only have to pay $ 725 .
it is , isn ’ t it ?
i'd like to help pitch in with dinner .
ok . now how can i help , hon ?

yes , we do . we also eat mutton .
that's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ?
certainly i can , i'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday .
i don ’ t think we need too much in the way of soft drinks . two super bottles of cola should cover everyone . what about wine ?
no , once i fill the tub with beer , i ’ ll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better .

i ’ m a new student . my name ’ s robert .
are you french ?
no , i ’ m not .
i ’ m italian . are you a teacher ?
what ’ s your job ?
what color is your new dress ?
thanks you .
what color is it ?
come and meet our employees , mr . richards .
this is nicola grey , and this is claire taylor .
they ’ re keyboard operators . this is michael baker , and this is jeremy short .
they ’ re sales reps . they are very lazy .
no , not those . the ones on the shelf .
yes , please .
what are you going to do with that vase , penny ?
don ’ t do that . give it to me .
i ’ m going to put it here , in front of the window .
there we are ! it ’ s a lovely vase .
hello , helen .
how are you today ?
i ’ m fine , thanks . how is tony ?
she ’ s very well , too , helen . goodbye , helen . nice to see you .
give me a book please , jane .
no , not that one . the red one .
i need to talk to you about something .
i have some questions about my lease .
exactly how long is my lease for ?
what will happen if i move out before then ?
i don ’ t understand .
these are chocolate , and those are almond flavored .
no , they're really quite easy . wait a minute , i've got the recipe right here . see . these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
can we talk ?
i ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease .
how many years is my lease for ?
can i move out before those three years ?
why would you keep it ?
i get it now .
i would like to talk to you , if you have time .
i want to discuss some things about my lease .
can you tell me when my lease is up ?
if i ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ?
why is that ?
oh , i see .
absolutely . that's the most important thing to take into consideration . i'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
the name ’ s stanley morris and the order was for two chef ’ s salads .
what kind of a car do you have ?
nothing like that . my cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it cheap . it's practically new .
would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
it's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
you're finally here ! what took so long ?
it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
it would be better for the environment , too .
taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
so , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
we'd like to rent a flat near the university .
yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month .
we'll need two bedrooms . the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined .
how far away is it from the campus ?
that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision .
i like this apartment . do you think we can afford the mortgage ?
i love the balcony . we can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . we are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony .
yes , and there are many houses nearby . i like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks .
yes , it would . don ’ t worry . there ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . this place will be fine .
that was a great dinner . i didn't know that you knew how yo cook .
i don't know . i'm pretty full . what are we having ?
ooh , that's my favorite . maybe i'll have a small slice .
i'll have a cup of tea .
actually , could i have some milk with that ?
i just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
she's on the m40 , near reading .
i don't know , she didn't say . i'm so sorry about this .
actually , i've only got a two seater . i'll have to go on my own .
is that your rabbit ?
that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit .
rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ?
that sounds pretty easy . do rabbits make your house smell ?
can you train a rabbit to do things ?
this bloody computer !
my computer just crashed again for the third time today !
i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery .
oh , no ! i thought it seemed a bit strange .
it's a pc . doesn't everyone have a pc in this office ?
what's the difference ?
i didn't know that .
yes .
fortunately , i saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be ok .
i can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap .
i ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors .
buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
do you like animals ?
what's your favorite animal ?
have you ever had a dog ?
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
how about cats ? have you ever had one for a pet ?
how did that happen ?
you must have been devastated !
i hope she does . do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
i hope your cat finds its way back home .
when do most children start school in your country ?
how much time do primary school students usually spend at school every day ?
do they have to go to school on saturdays ?
how many subjects do they have to study ?
do students have to wear uniforms in schools in america ?
did you go to a public school or a private school ?
i went to a boarding school from nursery school to senior high school .
yes , they were horrible . we had to wear green every day !
i want to buy some running shoes . maybe new balance .
but i exercise at the club . and i use the stepping machine . so i need good running shoes .
and what are running shoe style shoes ?
but they aren't as light , right ?
my sister has new balance running shoes . i want shoes just like hers . i don't care if they're expensive . and they look cool too .
i want the best . my sister said good shoes are very important . for support . they support your feet .
here it is . this is what my sister has .
i wonder if they have my size .
here in america , it's six .
it's time for desserts ! are you still hungry ?
what are you going to try first ?
do they serve the yogurt with anything ?
ok . mmm .
what do you think ? does it taste good ?
i'm glad you like it . i don't care for it . why don't you finish my tiramisu so that i can try one of those fried bananas ?
do you know where they are from .
do you want me to get you one , too ?
i like the honda accord you showed me before . i think it's more practical for my needs .
what does it come with standard ?
cruise control ? i don't like that .
i think it's dangerous . what if i can't turn it off ?
i wish it didn't have cruise control . my wife doesn't like it either .
i suppose . and what about the sunroof ? is that standard ?
i see . another important question is the time i can get this car . i need a new car rather soon .
that's good enough , i think . what colors does the new accord come in ?
my brother has last year's accord . and his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . i really like that color . i wonder if i can get that color on my accord .
yes , i think that's it . can i get that on the accord ?
well , i think i want to order the new accord then . it looks like an excellent car .
yes , i know . i think honda is the most reliable car on the road . i would never change to anything else . the honda i have now almost never has service problems . it runs smooth as silk .
why don't we get you some shirts ?
but we should get you some shirts while we're here . you need summer shirts .
why ? they have everything here .
let's just look and see what they have .
what about these shirts ? do you see anything you like ?
oh , come on ! don't be so sour . these are beautiful shirts . i know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself .
here . look at this shirt . try it on .
i don't know . let me look on the rack . here is one . large . try it on .
the fitting rooms are over there .
it looks good on you .
no , it looks great . why are you always like this when you're shopping ? you know it looks good .
i think we'll buy this one . and i want you to try on this one too .
you should be happy i want you to look good . if i let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything .
i really do like this dining set . but i just don't know . i don't know if i can do a good job with it .
what instructions ?
could you tell me now some of the things i need to do ?
do i have to sand every inch of the table ?
sawdust ?
that makes sense .
and after the varnish ?
and then ?
it all sounds very complicated .
well , i will look around your shop some more . i need to think about it .
how can i help you ?
did you have anything specific in mind ?
well , you made a good choice . coming to us , i mean . we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
our foundation is very high quality . only the finest ingredients . it will moisturize your skin and it has a sun block rating of 8 .
let me show you . we have this rose color . we also have different shades of beige .
in this size , we sell it for 53 . 95 .
what you're paying for , ma'am , are the ingredients . it is a very high quality product .
of course . here is our thickening mascara . we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
we have a very wide selection of colors . and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . so it is very gentle on your eyelids . would you like to sample some ?
i can help you with that .
what should i get uncle teddy ?
are you kidding ? that's the stupidest gift one can buy . i don't want to get a tie .
everybody gets men ties for christmas . it's too boring . everybody buys either ties or sweaters . i want a more unique gift .
that's a cool idea . at least it would be a surprise . but i'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .
yes . an iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal . so i have to find something halfway between .
well , he was very good to me . he helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest . so i want to spend at least 75 dollars .
yes .
what should he have then ?
i think that's a great idea . men look great with that kind of bag . where can we buy one ?
alright . we can go later then .
good plan . what should we get for mom though ?
alright . we can go check at sears and see if they have them . and what about dad ?
i think it would be a great joke . but i know we'd have to take the iguana back . and the pet store might not let us . so why don't we get him something else ? some clothes maybe .
oh , shut up about ties ! forget about ties , why not ?
may i help you , sir ?
i see . and does your son have a vcr now ?
does he watch a lot of movies ?
i would like to make a suggestion then , sir .
if your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself .
it is very similar . the technology is the same .
for one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better . that ' s because it's digital .
it is a little more expensive , sir . but there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate .
if your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long .
video tape breaks down after fifteen years . so if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot .
yes , it is , sir .
this is the excellent thing about dvds . if your son starts to collect dvds , they will last forever . they will never rot .
so let me show you some of our dvd players . in my opinion , dvd is the wave of the future .
hello . may i speak to brian , please ?
is this 777 9345 ?
oh , i ’ m so sorry .
hello . is becky there , please ?
thanks .

i ’ d like the lasagna , please .
do you like coffee , ann ?
do you want a cup ?
do you want any milk ?
do you like biscuits ?
do you want one ?
you ’ re working hard , george . what are you doing ?
which hammer . this one ?
here you are .
what are you going to do now , george ?
what colour are you going to paint it ?
pink !
can you make the tea , sam ?
yes , there is .
it ’ s over there , behind the teapot . can't you see it ?
there it is ! it ’ s in front of you .
there are some in the cupboard . can you find them ?
do you have any shoes like these ?
size five .
black .
but my sister bought this pair last month .
no , she bought them in the u . s .
can you get a pair for me please ?
they look very uncomfortable .
what are you doing , karen ?
what do we need ?
what about vegetables ?
have we got any beer and wine ?
i hope that you've got some money .
do you want any meat today , mrs bird ?
do you want beef or lamb ?
this lamb's very good .
what about some steak ? this is a nice piece .
do you want a chicken , mrs bird ? they're very nice .
what's ron marston like , pauline ?
what did your boss say to him ?
did he telephone again last night ?
what did you say to him ?
did he telephone again ?
good afternoon . i believe that this house is for sale .
may i have a look at it please ?
how long have you lived here ?
twenty years ! that's a long time .
then why do you want to sell it ?
how much does this house cost ?
that's a lot of money !
well , i like the house , but i can't decide yet . my wife must see it first .
can i help you ?
well , you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students .
well , first let's consider your computer . here , for example , is a system i highly recommend the power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory .
yes , it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ?
yes .
yes . it's an excellent system .
yes , it's a macintosh . it's apple . macintosh and apple are the same thing .
i'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment .
well , i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america , especially in universities and publishing companies , apple is very commonly used .
there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple .
no , don't be sorry . it's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me , most of the students here in the university asian students included most of them use apple .
no , i don't . you look pretty busy today . do you have an opening for me ?
just a haircut . i washed my hair this morning .
well , i last had a haircut eight weeks ago . so my hair is pretty long . but i want the same style .
alright . you are the expert . i'm happy to have your recommendation .
fine .
yes .
yes , i know my hair is quite thin . it runs in my family . everybody has very thin hair .
i don't know what to do about it .
do you sell conditioner here ?
great . i would be happy to try it . i know my hair doesn't look good now . it's too weak .
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
not necessarily . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
yes , that's often true . but you have to pay them .
it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . he will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time . that ' s why we haven't done it yet . it's very troublesome .
are you good at cooking ?
do you prefer chinese food or western food ?
have you tried traditional chinese dumplings yet ?
you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . if you do , you'll give your chinese friends quite an impression .
if you want , i can introduce you to some typical chinese dishes .
albert and i need a lot of things to furnish our house . but i don't know where the best place to shop is . can you give me some advice ?
well , we have most of the furniture already . we mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories things like that . and albert wants to set up a little off
can i write that down ?
thanks .
what do you mean ?
probably good prices . you know we will only be in america for about a year .
what are those stores ?
even silverware ?
i have a friend that said something about a place called price club . do you know about that ?
what does that mean ?
electronics ?
how much is the membership fee ?
i see . thanks for these tips . we really need to buy a lot of little things .
may i help you ?
alright . do you have your receipt ?
and why are you returning them ?
i see . oh , wait . ma'am , i'm sorry . these slacks were on sale .
i'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items .
well . let me talk to the manager for a moment . ma ' am , the manager says i can do it this time .
please show me your receipt again .
i will have to give you store credit , ma'am . if you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit .
i was just wondering if many chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant .
what happen to all the leftover food ?
that seems like an awful waste ! why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ?
i guess that makes sense . i just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home .
no , that's ok . you know what they say when in rome .
many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so i think they are ok .
that's a lot of cooking . you must save a lot of money by eating at home so much .
how about spicy food ?
what's your favorite dish to make ?
i'm so tired ! i don't know how i'm going to make it through this lecture .
i don't really like coffee , to be honest . it's too bitter for me .
most some drinks have too much sugar in them .
i like diet sprite . does that have any caffeine in it ?
i don't care for coke . i heard that coke was first used as a medicine and i don't like medicine . what else has caffeine ?
maybe . how about a mochaccino ? are they any good ?
that's perfect ! would you like one , too ? my treat .
do you have any plans for dinner tonight ?
i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ?
i recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ?
i bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start !
first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces .
yes . once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir fry them for a few minutes .
that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir fried on its own until its cooked through .
i'll prepare it . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ?
are you ready for your first driving lesson ?
the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas .
automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on .
very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ?
check your petrol situation .
hoo , i'm getting tired , jeanine , been a long day .
yeah , i know . shop till you drop .
i'm getting a little short on cash . let's just window shop a little .
hey , jeanine , get a load of that . it's beautiful .
you know i have a weakness for long dresses .
sure does . hey , can i sponge a little cash of you ?
hello , do you remember me ? i bought some vases from you yesterday .
well , first , i'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that , too .
posters are difficult to travel with . i think i'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice .
how much do they cost ?
yes , i think i'd like the green mask in the middle .
i'll take it , i'd also like to buy some chocolate .
yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate .
come on , let's go for lunch , gregory .
don't worry about it . it ' s on me .
i agreed , hi , guess what ? i went bungee jumping last weekend .
definitely . you know , i'm into serious sport in a big way .
come off it , it's not that serious . you should diy ( do it yourself ) sometime .
no , really , i think you'd like it . i adapted to it right off the bat .
i can teach you how .
hi , nally , are you hungry ?
where to ?
are you kidding ? that place is too ritzy for lunch .
let's stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch
that was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
wow , amy , look at that number .
what do you mean ? it's a scrim .
i love that kind of stuff .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking punk .
i don't care how much it costs . i'm rolling in it .
i got a replace my party outfit , i trashed it last week .
are you on the level ? you're the one who called me , remember ?
excuse me , could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?
that ’ s a really long line . how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?
can i buy stamps here ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
no .
and the bubble wrap ?
how can i help you ?
do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?
ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes .
personally , i quite like the new perfume by clinique . it's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ?
would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .
how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick .
how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger .
i know what she would like some whitening cream .
will that be all then ?
we really were lucky . we got the last available table for two and we didn't even have a reservation ! did you see the long lines behind us ?
let's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ?
what's in a dahl ?
that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
that's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ?
ok , shall i flag down the waitress ?
you're right . that might seem a bit rude . it's a good thing i've got you with me !
can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? i'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding .
it depends on the price , but i was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend .
i was thinking of a brown pin striped suit .
haven't you heard ? brown is the new black .
that may be true , but black is so boring . anyway , i already have three black suits . i might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest .
i like the one on the left , but i don't like the pattern on it . it's too much . i want a pattern that's a bit subtler .
i think that will do . let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made .
alright , tell me what you think .
yeah , maybe you ’ re right . how about this outfit ?
no , i don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it ’ s casual , yet sophisticated .
how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?
that ’ s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense .
yep . here it is . what do you think ?
the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ?
that ’ s even better than the real thing .
it ’ s so great to be here ! i ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !
that ’ d be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ?
that would be lovely , thanks .
i ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
well , i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but i don ’ t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient .
i see . well , i can help with the chores while i ’ m here . you two could probably use my help .
how is your house hunting going ?
how much are you looking to spend ?
looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .
well , if you want to live in london , you have to pay the price !
i can ask around at work . do you have a preference for makers or non smokers ?
how long do you want to sign a contract for ?
do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ?
you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ?
it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities .
don ’ t worry . sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children .
no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . i want to repay the favor .
oh , that was just a quick bite to eat that doesn't count !
how much is this ?
the large one .
oh , yes . i think i'll look at those over there before i decide .
what ? i don't understand .
oh ! ha ha ! that's not what i mean when i said ' go dutch ' !
' going dutch ' means to split the bill , silly !
broadway mall is having a big sale this weekend . you wanna go ?
well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
how can i get to lakeside park ?
will it take me straight there ?
hello . excuse me . do you know if there's a commercial bank around here ?
straight on , and turn right . is it far ?
thanks very much .
have you thought of moving at all sarah ?
buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .
well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
sure , my sister in law and her husband just bought a house that way . they ’ re pretty satisfied with it .
not at all . the woman , who owned it , took good care of it . but when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her .
it ’ s such a nice day outside . let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window shopping .
i know . but we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . window shopping won ’ t cost you anything .
well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor .
fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time .
i promise . we ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for .
do you have any money ?
for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street .
i agreed to not go into the mall , but i can still look at things in the market !
mon and i got in another fight , boris .
it was over food . i simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no .
oh , she keeps saying that . she never allows me to have them .
but , boris , i am not a baby any more .
how about your mother ?
poor you . it seems we are in the same boat .
really ? so you don't have fried food at all .
how do you manage it ?
what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
that's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
i haven't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ?
oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ?
good afternoon ! can i help you ?
of course . the fitting room is right over there .
i'm sorry . all the back of that size are sold out . would you like a red one ?
oh , that suits you very well . besides it is believed in china that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
our pleasure . please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
boris , look at this sentence . healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . it's interesting , isn't it ?
i believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories .
seriously ?
maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet .
i'm so hungry . shall we go eat now , rick ?
how about some dumplings ? i just can't get enough of them .
well , what do you have in mind ?
oh , it's too spicy for me . don't you remember last time when i tasted the lamb ? it was so spicy my eyes teared up !
sounds great . do they serve noodles ? i am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well .
great . let's go !
wow , the duck looks so delicious . should we order it , rick ?
i see . the chef is so skillful with his knife .
incredible . by the way , what are these in the plates ?
thank you . i couldn't wait any longer to have a taste .
oh , it's terrific . i love the floor . can you tell me how it was prepared ?
it sounds really complicated . no wonder it tastes so great .
i'm sorry for running it , but i really didn't know .
i know that .
i'm not sure .
i'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
i would like to make an offer on this house , but i don ’ t know much about the process .
i really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
that sounds good , but i don ’ t want this house to get away from me .
when will we know if they accept the offer ?
should i be contacting my bank in the meantime ?
do you want to practice your driving right now ?
are you buckled up ?
start the car .
i'll tell you when to stop .
we're back now , so why don't you try parking ?
are you a good driver ?
i need you to teach me how to drive .
yes , i have it .
i drove a car before , but only once .
i already know all of them .
when do you have time ?
i have a parking ticket to pay for .
yes , i remembered to bring my ticket with me today .
i didn't bring my id .
what do you need my id for ?
all right , i see what you mean .
will everything be cleared from my record ?
isn't it past your bedtime already ?
it's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
try listening to some soft music .
i really don't care , just go to sleep .
you'll be up all night if i let you do that .
you need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
do you have any idea what time it is ?
do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ?
didn't i tell you to call when you're running late ?
it doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know .
if you do this again , don't even bother coming home .
exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules .
may i take your drink order while you are looking over your menu ?
the wine list is on the second page of your menu .
would you like that drink blended or on the rocks ?
would you like it with salt or no salt ?
i'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer .
i need help turning them on .
how may i help you ?
everything on it ?
would you like fries with that ?
would you like anything to drink ?
will that be all ?
your total comes to $ 5 . 48 .
i hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook .
haven't i asked you to call if you're going to be home late ?
regardless , all you had to do was give a call .
come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside .
that's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules .
i would like high speed internet installed in my house .
i'd like to make an appointment right now .
i would like to have it done this friday .
is it possible for someone to come a little earlier ?
how about saturday ?
can i take your drink order ?
the wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table .
we can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar .
our house special is our cuervo gold margarita .
can i prepare your drink on the rocks , or would you prefer it blended ?
do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ?
what are we going to eat for dinner ?
i thought you were making dinner tonight .
your food tastes so much better than mine .
you really want me to cook tonight ?
no problem .
would you like me to come get you when the food is done ?
so , what's on the menu for dinner tonight ?
you're not going to make anything to eat ?
i think you're a better cook than i am .
so you're telling me that you want me to make dinner ?
i'll cook dinner , don't worry .
i'll come wake you when it's ready , okay ?
i'm so hungry ! can you buy me a burrito ?
please ? i haven't eaten anything all day .
i'm so hungry , i could eat a whole cow !
i get paid on friday , i'll pay you back then .
that's pretty messed up .
i don't want to go all the way home just to eat .
i'm hungry .
where should we go eat today ?
i never bought food from the cafeteria .
what do they have ?
well , i want chinese food .
i guess we can eat there then .
can you go to the store for me ?
just a couple things , here's a list .
no , i think that's all that i need .
if you can , could you pick up my prescription for me ?
i think so . it should be .
thank you so much .
my stomach feels so empty .

i'm glad to know that you like her .
hello , i'm returning your phone call .
no problem , but what were you calling about ?
is he messing up in school ?
what was he doing ?
i don't know what's gotten into him .
i will get right on that , and i am very sorry .
i have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house .
i absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more .
i hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer .
does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ?
should i be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ?
did you call me ?
what did he do ?
exactly what did he do ?
i don't know what his problem is .
that won't happen again , i'm sorry .
have the owners come up with a counter offer to my offer to buy their home yet ?
should i accept their offer ?
what if i make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ?
i think that i would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter offer .
how long before i find out what their decision is ?
i believe that you called me ?
why did you call me ?
what do you mean ?
that's really not like him .
i apologize , and i'll make sure he doesn't do that again .
have the owners answered back with a counter offer for my offer to purchase the house ?
that sounds pretty good to me , but i am not sure what to do .
if i make another offer and they refuse , then what ?
let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter offer .
do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ?
you have completely damaged my car .
you don't see what happened to my bumper ?
your bumper looks exactly the same .
give me your information , in case i don't hear from you .
i was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter offer .
did they go with the proposed counter offer ?
is a home inspection very expensive ?
do i get to choose who inspects the home ?
can you call the owners with my acceptance right away ?
yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .

i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .

let ’ s sign the registry . the realtor looks kind of busy right now .
oh look , they have some refreshments in here .
from the looks of this house from the outside , i don ’ t really think that i want to go inside .
i am not impressed by the interior of this house .
with so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ?
where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ?
is there a dead animal somewhere in here ?
were you able to contact the owners about my counter offer ?
i hope that they accepted the counter offer .
will the home inspection cost me a lot ?
how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ?
i see an open house sign over there , and i think we should go check it out .
yes , i see it listed on the printout we got off of the internet .
we need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here .
on such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers .
what is the price of this house in the flyer ?
what can i do for you today ?
what do you need to know ?

i've only done it once .

whenever you have time .
your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers .

i feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers .
my boyfriend is an attorney and told me that i could fax him anything if i had a question .
is this the last thing that i will need to do before the house becomes mine ?
did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter offer ?
how much will that cost ?
can i choose the home inspector ?
have you taken the written test yet ?
you should study before you take it .
why don't you take the test ?
since you already paid for your permit , you don't have to pay again .
no , the test skips a lot of things in the book .
no , i didn't , because it was pretty hard .
i have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer .
i love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
we could try that , but i really want this house !
how long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer ?
should i tell my bank that i have made an offer ?
your office called and said that the owners had made a counter offer to my offer to purchase their house .
i think that maybe i should accept their offer .
i want to make another offer , but i am afraid that they will decline and i will lose this house .
i would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter offer .
can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ?
how can i get my driver's license ?
i have yet to take my driving test .
when can i take my test ?
i would like to make one right now .
if i could do it in the morning , then that would be good .
how did i do ?
yes , i do .
i don't understand how i could've failed it .
what are the reasons ?
can i take the test again ?
can i apply for a permit today ?
i think i forgot it in the car .
i'm going to go and get my id from the car right now .
may i borrow your pen ?
thanks for your help .
no , i left it in the car .
one moment while i go and get my id .
okay , here's my id and the $ 27 .
thanks a lot .
i may have left my id in my car .
i'll go get it really quick .
i need to use a pen .
thank you very much .
so how did i do on my driving test ?
of course , i do .
how bad did i do ?
how ?
what were they ?
can i have another try ?
let's go practice your driving .
did you buckle your seatbelt ?
you need to start the car now .
i'll let you know when i want you to stop .
all right , try parking here .
did i do well on my test ?
why wouldn't i want to know ?
exactly what do you mean by bad ?
how'd i fail it ?
what did i do wrong ?
thanks . will i be able to take a retest ?

could i pay for my parking ticket ?
here's my ticket right here .

will my record be cleared after i pay the fine ?
have you ever gotten a parking ticket ?
how many is a few ?
have you paid all your tickets off ?
how much is the fine ?
that's not cheap at all .
did you ever get a parking ticket ?
yeah , i just got one the other day .
the ticket was for parking in the red zone .
there was nowhere to park , and i needed to run in and get something .
i parked in front of my apartment building .
but i really needed to be quick .
i need to pay the fine on my ticket .
yes , i have my ticket with me .
i forgot to bring that with me .
why can't i just give you the money for the fine ?
okay , i think i understand .
so once i pay this off , my record will be cleared ?
how many parking tickets have you gotten before ?
how many ?
have you paid off your parking tickets ?
how much do you have to pay for the ticket ?
that's a lot of money .
well , you better make sure you pay it off .
did you ever get a parking ticket ?
what's a few ?
did you pay your fines ?
how much are the parking tickets ?
that's expensive .
you should probably pay the fine soon .
have you ever gotten a parking ticket ?
i got a ticket yesterday .
i needed to get something really quick .
at my apartment building .
i needed to be fast .

where do most of them come from ?
where is the bus ?
it should've been here 30 minutes ago .

me too , it's so unreliable .
it's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather .
i think it's time we started driving .

the style of the exterior is just what i ’ ve been looking for !
this home is gorgeous on the inside !
the wall colors totally suit the style of this house .

can i ask you a question ?
how do you get along with the american students in your classes ?
really ? why not ? don ’ t you go up and talk to them ?
you won ’ t get anywhere that way . you ’ re the one who needs to practice english , so you should make the first move . besides , most american students are really friendly and outgoing . they will be glad to talk to you .
hi . are you new in this class ?
did you just arrive in this country ? you look a little nervous .
i took this course last semester too . now i am taking it again !
wow , you have a lot of questions ! i learned a lot . in fact , that ’ s why i am taking it again . i get lots of practice in speaking , and also in writing . i ’ m sure you ’ ll be glad you took this course . i ’ ll even help you study if you ’ d like .
i really want to take a nap . i feel very sleepy today .
i fell asleep very late . it was almost two o ’ clock in the morning when i finally fell asleep .
you know how it is when you ’ re in a strange country . everything is new , and you get tired and nervous sometimes . then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . i tried to fall asleep but i just had too much on my mind .
do you mind if i ask you a question ? if it ’ s too personal you can forget it .
have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ?
i have a tuition scholarship from the university . otherwise i ’ m on my own .
oh no . my family supports me . and believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart breaking . you seem to get so little in return .
i was wondering if you could help me with something .
actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .
what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
don ’ t worry about that . i can point it out in the store .
i really think all americans look alike .
they wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own parker fountain pens ; they all drink coca cola , and they all chew gum .
yes , i have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . i ’ m not very good at reading maps .
more or less . i go to three different buildings , and always get there late . i feel so hopeless . i don ’ t know why i am late all the time . no one else seems to be .
that ’ s all right . we ’ ll teach you .
not very much . it ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .

i just moved into my apartment , and the plumbing is not working .
the bathtub barely drains at all .
it just started happening last night .
i will not be home .

i don ’ t understand what the big deal is .
what you would like me to do about it ?
i won ’ t be able to fix it at the moment .
if that ’ s the case , then i will fix the faucet .
during that horrible rainstorm last night , my roof began to leak .

mr . : for tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . then do exercises one through ten on page 21 .
mr . : no . you only do that when you write reports .
mr . : for those of you who don't have a calculator , get one .
hey , brad . how was your day ?
i'm going home .

so he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon .
ms . : do you have a question , mary ?
ms . : let me give you a hall pass for it .

a chance ? not just a chance , i'm a hundred percent certain . everyone says my voice is beautiful .
i still have 5 days to practise . it's in the bag !
hi , li ming . you look upset . what's the matter ?

what subject do you like best ?
no wonder your english is so good .
how do you usually get to school ?
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car .
i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it's just so convenient .
do you have a car ?
maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn't be so tempted to use it .
that's true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs .
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
oh , linda . you must be so excited about going to study in america .
well , i am sure you will .

pretty good . say , where are you living this semester ?
oh , i am looking for an apartment . i prefer living off campus . i can study better .
okay , see you around .
mary , there's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave .
you have to take the math and english evaluation tests .
because you're from a foreign country . the school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills .
you are a smart girl !
mr . : hello , mary .
mr . : i'm mr . taylor , and i'm your counselor . i'm going to show you around the school .
mr . : right here is the cafeteria .
mr . : and over here is our gymnasium .
are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus ?
mr . : there are two things that you'll need to know .
mr . : the school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch .
mr . : furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves .
mr . : the school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . so only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students .
mr . : are you mary lin ?
mr . : i'm mr . rogers , your homeroom teacher .
mr . : why don't you sit behind brad ?
mr . : he's that guy in the blue shirt .

i am looking for some information about home stay .
how did you pay them ?
today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . but people have different views about lifelong learning . how do you understand lifelong learning ?
does that mean studying all the time ?
then the axiom ' you can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer .
yes , i agree with you . when i retired i will participate in programs to keep momentally active .
you are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school .
isn't there anything else ?
you must have a high iq score .

seriously ? but you are such a genius .
well , perhaps you're right . sometimes eq matters more than iq .
ok , thank you . i'm going to the library , are you coming ?
you know that ? joan has got the scholarship .
but i think henry is a backroom boy . he always helps her with her study .
don't be so worried , you know professor robert is not too strict .

well , that's a good question . i haven't swum for almost two years . i think i need more practice .
what's wrong , dave ? you look down today .
well , english is a paper tiger . its natural enemy is adequate practice .
i suggest you read english texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . that will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language .
bill , i have received the admission letter from cambridge university !
how about you ? have you got any news from university ?
while you're picking out a record to play , i'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator .

what's to come next ?
how long will it take to go over all the procedures ?
thank you . i appreciate all your help .
we're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . do you want to join us ?
after you try it once this way , i don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again .
we plan to get together once a week .
we were talking about wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight .
does that actually work for you ?
i like to use shorthand note taking .
hmm . i never thought about it that way .
i have two finals this week and one oral presentation and i'm not ready for any of them !
i hate this part of school .
i didn't mean to . things just kept taking up all of my time .
i think i'd better . i have twenty four credits this time around . that might be a bit much .
kelly , the guys and i think you should run for senior class president .
yes . did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? the job doesn't stop when we graduate .
hello , are you chinese ?
i think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
do not take things so seriously , my pal ! every one of us will face the trouble and job hunting is inevitable . take it easy ! believe in yourself and some day you will be successful .
we need to elect club officials before the summer starts .
let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting .
can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e mail to all the club members ?
let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . doesn't that seem logical ?
i really like my debate class .
i've entertained the idea . but i'm i leaning more toward politics .
that's not like you to generalize .
i think i can do a lot of good for our country .
i went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . and i got a job .
they got me a part time tutoring job , teaching an australian businessman chinese .
it's very simple actually . you can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . they will give you a call if any job comes up .
can i help you ?
we have some catalogues from u . s . universities . you may check in the reference stacks over there .
well , generally in the u . s . each university has its own outstanding fields . but the graduate school accepts no applications after january 29th .
so you have to apply to begin the first semester next year .
there are things that are actually even smaller than atoms .
they are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons .
of course there is . things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can .
really ?
but some classmates said you took the money .
look at my eyes .
return the money to jim and make an apology . i think he will forgive you .
good morning , miss .
i've been looking forward to the new semester .
really ? i hope we will do much better under her guidance .
by the way , how many books am i allowed to check out ?
how long can i keep the books ?
i'm so nervous about this oral test .
why do you look so gloomy ? what are you looking for ?
did you finish typing it yesterday ?
don't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
how about the shelf ?
don't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh , what's this ? is this your dissertation ?
you ’ ve put it among these journals .
johnny , you did badly on the test . i think you haven't been studying enough . am i right ?
emily , what kind of report is this ?
i got a ninety five on my test .
the final examination will be held at the end of this month . have you made good preparation ?
are you sure you can do well this year ?
uh oh . i'm in trouble .
i just remembered that i've got to give a speech in class today and i forgot to prepare for it .
hi ! ed , what's up ?
doesn't look like it to me .
woo , easy .
maybe i can help .
you've got to be joking .
excuse me . can you tell me how to find some books on social science ?
yes .
so if i'm looking for a look called a history of western society , i'd just look under ' a ' .
what if i don't know the title of the book ?
i hear that the students ' union is going to take new members .
of course you can if you like it .
there will be an information session about the students ' union this tuesday . you can apply for it then .
is that mr . green ?
i am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . welcome aboard , i'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc .
can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a bachelor's degree ?
how long does it take to earn a bachelor's degree ?
hey , chill out , i'm just trying to help .
so , what's the problem ?
no kidding ! didn't you study for it ?
that's too bad , anyway , i'm sure things will turn around next semester .
he had moved and held a party on july 1st .
even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends .
have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ?
i think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system .
richard , why didn't you come to school today ?
i wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book .
i'm frustrated .
i can't work out this problem .
it just happened to be the highest grade in the class .
is this the a housing office ?
i was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full .
please . and in the mean time , can i look at apartments available in the area from this office ?
who do i talk to if i want i to see some of them ?
which country do you want to go to ?
were i in your position , i'd go to america .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard , yale , the university of michigan , and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ?
wow . i'm getting rushed too , but just one . are you thinking of joining any of them ?
were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ?
how many credits are you taking this semester ?
what's the matter , are the classes you want full ?
if you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ?
have you even thought that far ahead ? i mean what country would you like to do business with ?
i am sorry to trouble you again , mr . stone .
where should i go after i arrived at the university ?
why ?
what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
can we get any more help at the international center ?
i see . it must be worth going to .
what are you going to do for one year abroad , tom ?
you are going to take courses ?
sounds hard .
won't you get lonely ?
what do you think of your teacher ?
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
could you tell me how to use the library ?
how many books am i allowed to check out at a time ?
how long can i keep the books ?
i see . now i want to check out two books on spoken english . can you show me where i can find them ?
thank you very much .
hi . what's your name ?
my name is jessica . it's nice to meet you .
no . i'm a sophomore . i take it you are a new student ?
have fun while it lasts . the excitement wears off real quick . especially after you see how much homework you get . where are you from ?
i have never been to korea . i've been to japan before , but never korea .
my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he's so into learning about different cultures .
i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents .
thanks for the offer . i'll keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we'll talk more after class .
hey john , did you register for classes yet ?
what classes do you plan on taking ?
is that class really that popular ?
what other classes are you going to take ?
i took that class already . there is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad .
i had professor mahoney .
i'm not sure if he is or not , but i thought he was definitely fair .
i got a 4 . 0 in that class .
it's not what it appears . i actually tried harder in the 101 class . if i put as much effort into the 201 class , i would have received the same grade .
did you get your grades yet ?
why ? what happened ?
ouch . you must be very disappointed .
why don't you re take the class next year ?
i didn't do that well either . i ended up with a 3 . 2 this semester . that drops my total gpa to 3 . 45 .
what was your gpa before this semester ?
why did it go down so much ?
what happened to you ?
you better stop slacking off .
hi mark .
how was your summer vacation ?
i took summer school . i withdrew from two of my classes last year so i wanted to make them up .
she dropped out of school completely .
she worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time .
it sounds good now , but i'm traditional . i want the degree , so i wouldn't have accepted the offer .
hey mike . i forgot about registration . i'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . what do you think i should do ?
do you think going to the registration building will help at all ?
did you register yet ?
what classes do you think are still open ?
that's helpful . thanks . but what do you think about philosophy . i wanted to take that class this semester .
that makes sense . i think i'll do that . thanks for all the help .
did you already take the history exam ?
i take it tomorrow morning . there is so much material that i dont know what to emphasize on . what types of questions did you get ?
what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ?
hopefully he will use the same exam , cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
aright . thanks for the info . i gotta go to the library now .
can i help you ?
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
i ’ m sorry . it ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . but you ’ re welcome to look through it .
all right . they ’ re due back next wednesday .
hi kevin , how was your year at college ?
it was good . do you have a girlfriend at school ?
good morning , john . have you finished reading the novel by dickens borrowed from the library ?
i'm sorry to hear that . how are you feeling now ?
how many days do you plan to finish reading it ?
ok . after three days , i will come to you for it .
you'd better prepare for the examination .
you should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course .
han maimed , what's your plan for the weekend ?
i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays .
come on , han maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . a lot of americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .
yes , they are compatible . actually , the u . s . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england .
because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans .
that ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in england . many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
yes , that's why puritans moved to the new world , where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans . later on , it was these puritans who founded harvard college .
many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
actually harvard was first named ' new college ' , without a formal name .
in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman .
remember that harvard is a part of the united states . so you have to know the u . s . history and culture if you want to have in depth knowledge of harvard . the two are closely related .
hey jack . how were your classes this semester ?
would you consider it your favorite class ?
what class was your favorite then ?
did you ever take history 231 ?
who was the professor ?
that's probably because he grades on a curve .
hi jackie . you don't look too well . what's going on ?
the best thing to do is study as much as you can . i'm sure you'll do alright .
i have to study for an exam too . why don't we study together . we can encourage each other .
hi ! dick . where are you going ? you're in such a hurry .
what are you going to play ?
it's weekend again , i'm glad i can arrange for my personal matters .
oh , that means i can do whatever i like without few interruptions .
oh , you can't think like that . we young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . you like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?
i quite agree with you . with our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .
david , what do you want to do after graduation ?
that sounds like a hot job , right ? but in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account .
it's a sunny day , isn't it ?
my name is david . nice to meet you , too .
no , i'm a britisher . where do you come from ?
yes . what about you ?
great . maybe we can study and play games together . i think we can be good friends .
could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ?
ok . and how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ?
i see . thank you very much .
i think it is time to study . our chemistry exam is coming .
december 1st .
it seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten .
why are you so pessimistic ?
i believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . don't lose your heart .
good morning , madam . i'd like to apply for a library card . can you help me ?
ok . here you are .
ok . here is the money . and if i return the card , can i get the refund ?
ok . i see . thank you .
peter , which club do you want to join ?
we have a class outing today .
the teacher just canceled the test .
whip me if i get below 80 marks out of 100 !
welcome to our school . if you need any help , please come to me .
i failed the exam because i didn't study .
peter , have you finished your english composition ?
class starts in twenty minutes . you have to turn it in at the beginning of class today .
do you think you can finish it on time ?
you ’ d better hurry !
you should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes .
just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim . and things like that .
ok . here you are . anybody who wants help , please come to me .
good morning , miss li .
i'm sorry that i was absent yesterday .
i feel much better now .
i've already got it . thanks .
would you like to come to our party ?
what happened ? you look so pale .
what makes you say that ?
oh , that's too bad . work harder next term .
what's this then ?
but this should have been handed in last thursday .
well , what's your excuse then ?
oh , yes ?
professor , i've handed in my paper . did you read it ?
what about water pollution instead of pollution ?
good morning . mrs . smith .
well , what kind of books does she like ?
i see . has she read any detective stories ?
do you know if she's read this one ?
ah ! she has a bad memory . how old is she ?
can i help you ?
i'll certainly try to help you . what topic is your paper on ?
there are several possible sources you might use for that topic . i suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
harry potter ? is that book funny ?
got it .
no , but my little brother likes it very much .
i'll try to read it . actually , i like literature very much .
jane austen .
may , could you bring this note to professor li for me today ?
i know . but attending miss li's class is just waste of time . no more than one third of her students will go to her class .
yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . or i chat with my friends through text messages .
right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses .
what can i do ? i have things to do in students ' government .
sometimes i will try various excuses . but this is my last time asking for leave . or i will have a bad record .
i am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . but before that , i must do my job . bye . don't forget about that note .
i noticed your absence in class this morning .
can i help you ?
here you are . you must return them within a month .
you can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them .
it's the 17th week now , isn't it ?
oh , the final exam is coming soon . i feel a little bit nervous .
no , i haven't began my preparations .
great . you can help me a lot with english .
good morning , miss .
yes . here's my identification .
thank you very much . by the way , how many books am i allowed to check out ?
how long can i keep the books ?
i want a book on physics . could you show me where i can find it ?
i'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i've just come from china and i've never used a western library before . i'll be here for five years , so i'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .
sure . 3 thirty this afternoon .
would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ?
maybe another time . people say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ?
it's hard for me to imagine . how can you stand that ?
oh my god , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ?
because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week .
how do i apply to an american university ?
i was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply .
what's to come next ?
how long will it take to go over all the procedures ?
thank you . i appreciate your help .
i am going to give you an end of the unit test this friday . please be prepared for it .
review all the lessons in this unit and see if you can understand the main idea of each lesson .
phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . you should know how to use them .
certainly .
well . when you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then i will give you some coaching .
where are you going ?
i didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . tell me about it .
i really admire you for that . how is it going ?
what are you going to do for your year abroad , tim ?
you ’ re going to take courses ?
sounds hard .
won ’ t you get lonely ?
i ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for .
i ’ m not sure . what ’ s the difference between them ?
which is better ?
i hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools .
want to meet for lunch this saturday ?
what are you doing ?
what kind of volunteer work ?
oh , yeah ?
what are you studying all day long for ? it ’ s summer vacation !
why ?
do you think it will help ?
hmm . maybe i should sign up too .
hello . can i help you ?
i'm sorry , but that class is already full . and also , students are supposed to register through the touch tone registration system .
that's because it's full .
well , i could put you on a waiting list . but that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . what is your name ?
alright . and what is your major ?
wait a minute . you're a comp lit major ?
why didn't you tell me ? i didn't know you were one of our students .
the university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . i can give you a special code . when you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class .
that's right .
sure . here is the code number , with information on how to use it .
sure . just call the touch tone registration system again . then , follow the directions on the sheet . you will get in no problem .
have you decided what you are going to take next semester ?
good . i think it's a good idea . our department should require meetings like this .
yes , that happens .
alright . good . i see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements . you have one botany class and one chemistry class . and political science . so that's nine credits . did you take english composition 201 ?
excellent . i see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester . and the modern novel class . you haven't taken a shakespeare class yet .
actually , i recommend you take shakespeare sooner rather than later .
let me look at the timetable . shakespeare meets monday , wednesday and friday at 11
good . i recommend it . shakespeare is of course enormously important . we want our students to take the class as soon as they can . and professor friedman is an excellent teacher .
tell me , lisa , what made you decide to be an english major ?
really ? that's great to know .
alright , we need to have a plan here . first of all , which bed do you want ?
alright . do you have a coin ?
oh , well . so you get the bottom bunk . what about our stereos ? it looks like we both brought our stereos . probably we only have room for one .
no , i don't mind . i just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room .
alright . that's a good plan . what about the desks ? we have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? which one do you want ?
yes , i agree .
is that right ?
well , i hope you let me hang out with you then . maybe i can learn from you .
are all lucky people so stuck up ?
anyway , i get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . that's it .
i will go get something to eat . you unpack first . then , when i come back , i'll unpack .
how can i help you today , alice ?
oh , good . you're an excellent student . i'd be very willing to help you with that .
what kind of scholarship is it ?
fine . i know about that scholarship . you have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3 . 7 or higher .
do you have an essay you want to send them ?
what is the question ?
that's a pretty short essay .
good luck . i'm sure you will do a good job .
i'd be happy to write one for you .
what is it ? do you want me to read your essay ?
of course i could read it . that's no problem . but you need to get it to me soon .
alright . if you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , i can talk with you after class on friday . so i'll have some feedback for you before the weekend .
can i help you ?
these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful .
i ’ m sorry . it ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . but you ’ re welcome to look through it .
all right . they ’ re due back next wednesday .
excuse me . do you study chinese at the university here ?
it takes a long time to learn chinese writing .
yes , i am . i am from taiwan . i came here to study political science .
i like it so far . but my english still needs work .
does the chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?
yes , that's true . especially my writing . i think my papers aren't good enough . i make too many grammatical mistakes .
you mean you and i ?
how would we manage it though ? how would we spend the 90 minutes ?
would i help you with writing ?
i think it sounds like a good system . but when is it convenient to meet ?
me too . in fact , i'm free until 1
let me give you my phone number .
oh . i am really worried about the exam . i have no idea what will be on it .
yes .
what do you mean ? you think i don't write enough .
i know , but i listened .
i suppose you're right . but what can i do ? i don't know what to write down .
that would really help me , sue . i appreciate it . all this makes me feel like an idiot .
you know . i did very poorly on that test .
well , you know how i am about exams . i'm a perfectionist .
can i help you ?
are you a professor ?
yes , i am kidding . but don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ?
oh , i'm sorry . i didn't know .
here is the application form . i also need to see your student id and your permission letter from the university .
yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability . and it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place .
yes . or you can bring it yourself .
let me look in the file then . maybe we received it .
yes , here it is . alright . then i just need your completed application form , and i will be able to process your request .
the form has a map on the back . you may specify your top four choices . we will give a spot in the lot that has an opening .
i don't know what i'm going to do . i need to find a job . if i don't , i won't be able to stay here next semester .
what do you mean ?
yes , i know . i tried that . they don't have anything now . so what can i do ?
i know that . you don't have to tell me that . that's my problem . i know i have the right to work for the university . that's legal . but they don't have a job for me . and it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere .
but i need a pretty decent job . i need to make enough to pay my rent at least .
what ?
i already had that idea .
but i don't know what i would do .
maybe . i don't know .
excuse me . do you have a minute ? i'd like to tell you about the bucky card .
do you know about the bucky card ?
the bucky card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school . it gives you discounts on all kinds of things . movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies .
the card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer . but it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges . so if you want to see your favorite band at amy's or cosmo's club , you get a discount on the entrance fee .
usually it's two dollars off the cover price .
this pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts . and twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet . the bucky card has just started . every couple months we have new businesses joining our program . it ' s a great way for students to save money !
it costs only 19 dollars a year for a card .
but think of how much money you'll save ! you can use it for a year .
good luck on your test tomorrow . we'll be crossing our fingers for you !
why ?
do you mind if i sit here ?
what are you studying ?
i said , bonjour !
i ’ m speaking french . don ’ t you know anything ?
well , i just got back from my language school . we have to speak french all day there . no english allowed !
i ’ m trying to learn new skills . it makes me more qualified for a good job .
the answer for number 6 is c , 7 is b , 8 is a .
sure . 7 is b . any others ?
i hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades .
she did last time .
maybe you should talk to the teacher .
you never know unless you try .
you ’ re not going to believe what happened today . you ’ ve got to promise to keep it to yourself .
today mr . leo threw sally out of class !
hello , this is the admissions office . can i help you ?
what would you like to know ?
yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects .
if you give me your address , i can mail you an information packet and the application forms .
wake up , erik , time to rise and shine .
you and everyone else . it looks more like a camp ground than a library .
have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ?
well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of mexico . you seem to be interested in that part of the world .
so they limit it to one region of mexico . say the yucatan . you ’ ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics .
what ’ s your schedule like this year ?
what ’ s your major ?
oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? it ’ s really difficult . i hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long .
when is it due ?
i wanna register for this mathematics course .
closed ? the clerk told me i could come back and register any time during the first week of classes .
some woman in here when i tried to register three weeks ago . she said i just had to pay a late fee .
she said i couldn ’ t until i had my birth certificate . here it is .
serious ? only the proof of my address .
great .
are you planning on studying abroad ?
good afternoon , everyone . the experiment is to start at 3 . have you gone through the instructions ?
ok , now some points for attention . first of all , pay attention to safety . now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . if there is any question , just let me know .
have you turned it on ?
ok , i will get you another one .
this is our first day of class . it ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . who would like to begin first ? any volunteers ?
yes , please .
now let's begin the class . who is on duty today ?
how did you choose courses when you were abroad ?
wait a minute . there are some new terms for me . i can hardly follow you .
everything is so new to me . i think i'll have to experience a very difficult period when i get there .
i am very grateful for your advice .
what's your schedule like this year ?
what's your major ?
oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? it's really difficult . i hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long .
what's up ?
no , lucy . don't get me wrong . i mean school will be open on sept . 2nd , and i will have a very tight schedule by then .
that will be fine . when can i see him ?
make sure you come here before noon . i will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon .
by bus , of course .
great . by the way , what does your friend do ?
ok , see you then .
how many courses do you have for this semester ?
how are they proportioned ?
may i ask a question ?
what does mph stand for ?
how is your new dormitory ?
you'll have to take a make up exam in logic .
sorry to say you failed .
who is it ?
wait a sec .
we're watching a football match . what's the matter ?
i'm sorry about this .
bill , your work is too messy .
is this a promise ?
great ! they're the very books i want . may i borrow two books ?
i've got to go home and study .
hey , ann . you don't have a pen , do you ?
i am trying to decide what school to apply to ?
i am not sure . what's the difference between them ?
which is better ?
i hear you have to wear uniforms at private school .
there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard , yale , the university of michigan , and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .
the final examination will be held at the end of this month . have you made good preparation ?
are you sure you can do well this year ?
according to what you did last time , i have my doubts .
how did you do on your belts exam ?
do you know where the visa office is ?
can you help me do an internet search ?
i want to find information on world war two .
yes , i want to know about the normandy landing .
oh , wow ! there are lot of sites .
thanks .
i've been looking forward to the new semester .
hope so .
really ? i hope we will do much better under her guidance .
what are you going to do for one year abroad , tom ?
you are going to take courses ?
sounds hard .
won ’ t you get lonely ?
can i help you , sir ?
would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?
i'm sorry . it's out of stock now . could you come by again next week ?
well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that i can inform you as soon as we restock it ?
hey , jordan , is that you ? long time no see !
yeah , i think so ! i pledged phi iota alpha , so i'm living at the frat house now .
yeah , yeah , i know , it's totally cliche , but really , i think it's been a good decision . i've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . what about you ? what have you been up to ?
that sounds smart . but kind of boring .
that's cool . hey , so have you decided on your major yet ?
i still have no clue . but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so i've got time ! oops , i'm late for class . gotta run !
i'm afraid i can't complete my paper on time .
i keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . i can hardly go on .
wow ! look at all these books ! i bet i can find a book about anything here !
ok , i'm sorry . are you the librarian ? maybe you can help me , i am looking for a book .
i am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes .
no . how do i get one ?
here you go .
hey , wen ! welcome to d . c . ! glad you came out to visit !
howard is eighty percent black . but there are whites , and even asians here . thankfully , it's also coed .
sorry , nope . but the alpha phi alpha's are throwing a party tonight .
excuse me ? is this where i register ? i ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester .
here you are .
yes . i do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .
yeah . here ’ s my list . i ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .
oh yeah ! almost forgot ! i need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy .
how should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? we have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events .
do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ?
good idea . we should also hold a series of presentations . we could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .
we could have another on the successes of graduates from here .
a group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film .
i ’ m ok . i ’ m so busy !
yes . don ’ t you ?
which class are you working on right now ?
are you in mrs green ’ s class ?
yes . we must have the same exam tomorrow !
that sounds good .
do you speak only english in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish ?
i suppose she's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
it must be interesting to study english .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
hi , my name is lean , and i'm from russia .
to me english is a difficult language .
true , but english is harder than most . it's a crazy language .
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
what classes did you have ?
what do you think about the teachers ?
that ’ s too bad . how was your english teacher ?
where is she from ?
were you able to understand everything that she said ?
she sounds like a good teacher . do you think you ’ ll pass her class ?
what does that mean ?
if you like the class this much already , i ’ m sure you will .
did she give you any homework ?
who was the best teacher that you ever had ?
what was she like ?
what kind of things did you learn ?
anything ? do you really believe that we can do anything ?
you said she was strict . did she have a lot of rules ?
i see . she sounds like she really cared about her students .
why don ’ t you recommend one to me ?
well , you seem to enjoy speaking english .
i hope so . you see , at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . i'm awfully worried , i can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
who's that over here ?
what do you think of the teacher ?
what does she teach ?
can she speak chinese to her students ?
you're just left school , haven't you , emily ?
you sound relieved .
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
in my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon .
actually , five and a half . on saturday , we have classes only in the morning .
that's too much for us really .
i'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
hi , walter !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
you're got a point there . but do you think he's a little absent minded ?
do most students in the united states attend private schools or public schools ?
which students go to private schools , then ?
but are the public schools good everywhere ?
dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ?
are there many idioms in english ?
can you give us an example ?
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
why did the teacher criticise myra in front of the whole class ?
do you offer a course in business management ?
how many nights a week is it ?
and how long does the course last ?
when does it start ?
what time is the class ?
yes , that's all right . i want to enroll in the course .
do you want me to fill it out now ?
are you studying here ?
what are you major in ?
what do you think of the literature course .
come in , come in , what can i do for you ?
yes , i am applying on it .
aren't you a bit young ? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
well , if you think you are ready , i'll let you enroll .
why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ?
of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ?
hey , this is your order .
of course not . you know , there are many foreign customers like you here . and i think it's good for me to improve my oral english .
no , i'm not an english student . but i do like english . i'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 olympics where i want to be helpful with the language . so i try to improve my english .
thank you , sir . but i'm not allowed to accept any tips .
well , would you like something else ? the new made cafe parfait is really good . want some ?
sure . if you want more coffee , please go over there . there is self help coffee maker .
oops . well , wait for a while . we'll get it done quickly .
marquet , do you think i should enroll in the science course ?
right , i figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
yes , i really weak in maps , i did poorly in high school .
what do you like to do with your free time ?
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
studying english wouldn't give me any satisfaction . it's hard work .
let's program your courses , since you have had english literature , you should take american literature and american prose and fiction . you transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so i don't think you have any problem with it .
three , you also should take two three credit course in education department .
and then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time .
lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .
that ’ s not a big problem . there are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified .
and you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .
how is the college search going ?
but don't you want to study music ? shouldn't it be easy ?
i know . you have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school .
i see . well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . he usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . he gave me some information , and next week i'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended .
i hear you ’ re taking a music class . i didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it .
in my opinion , you ’ ll make it .
i wish i had access to the public library .
i've just got the examination results . i am afraid you haven't passed .
don't worry about that , i am sure they will understand . after all , it was a very difficult exam .
do you have your syllabus with you ? may i see it ?
let me see . oh yes . your professor has placed this book on reserve . that means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . you need to go to a special room called the reserve room . it's down the hall and to the right .
you see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . if one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . so , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve .
yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . the student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she must read it in the library during that time . that way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it .
will there be anything else ?
can i help you ?
i'll certainly try to help you . what topic is your paper on ?
there are several possible sources you might use for that topic . i suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ?
it's too high . i can't reach it . could you help me ?
how long can i keep these books ?
what if i can't finish them by then ?
any terrible fines ?
i've been thinking of taking i've been thinking of taking a crazy english course . do you think it's a good idea
really ? do you think english is that important ?
great ! it's always better to do things with a friend .
no , i left it at home . sorry !
so , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our english together tonight ?
no problem . i just got paid . it ' s my treat .
forget it ! that's what friends are for ! besides , i have a vip card for a discount .
did you have a part time job when you were still in school ?
yeah . i worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant .
it was always very busy there .
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
can i borrow these magazines ?
are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ?
can i help you ?
yes , but it's checked out .
fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book .
take the card , and fill in your name and library card number .
what can i do for you ?
have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ?
oh , maybe you can find something from the new york times , or the washington post during that period .
what would you say if i told you i was going to quit school ?
i don't know . i failed my exam .
a b plus .
no , i don't . i just don't know how to handle this . this is my first time , you know .
what ?
thanks . but i really don't feel like watching movies tonight . i have to get an early start in the morning .
i guess that's what i need . thanks . you're being a really good friend .
this is my admission card , and these are the books .
by the way , can i renew the borrowing ?
sense and sensibility , english version .
can i just do it here ?
ok , thanks .
i was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library . anyway , how much should i pay ?
here you are . thanks .
have we handed out all the water ?
nothing . the teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later .
terrific . there is one girl said , it is the best game i've ever watched .
clive was really outstanding . not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team .
on the other hand , i think the other team won everyone's respect . the leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool .
the thing i like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them .
there are lots of new teachers in our class this semester .
to be honest , i like all of them , except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . he's so boring .
it might be the english teacher . what about you ?
she is a pretty good teacher ! with her help i think i can make great progress in english .
i think it's a good way to develop our language ability .
i've been so stressed these days .
i don't know where to go for college , and what to major in .
and i also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . i want to get the burden off my family .
ok , ok . i'm so sorry . by the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ?
ok , honey , stop dreaming . you should face the reality .
en , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . second , i suggest you to take an additional course in some training center .
hi , maria , this is shirley .
hold on for a moment please . i'm fetching my textbook .
oh , the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense .
yes . you can use your textbook for your reference .
i don't think so , maria , but i think you can look for information on the internet .
oh , there isn't such a code called economic law . the economic law of china is a general concept for several laws .
are these your text books ? biochemistry , general ecology , botany , cell genetics , molecular genetics .
and when do you prepare for your final exam ?
really ? you only review your lessons in one month ? does it work ?
wow , and all the key points are included in them ? you're so smart !
do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ?
you are late again , maria . the teacher is about to come .
oh , ben has been cooking for us since i started attending this evening class . the good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking .
how about your one year old baby ?
how sweet of them ! i have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . i really hope i have eight arms and legs , like an octopus .
when is your adult college entrance exam ?
oh , my adult college entrance exam is also around then . i don't know if i can pass it .
so what do you feel like doing this evening ? how about going to the cinema ?
that's good ! i've also heard there will be a party held by the students ' union tomorrow evening . would you like to go with me tomorrow night ?
oh , god , i've forgotten it .
oh , no , i don't want to know any more geeks like you .
really ? is there a foreign teacher for every class ?
so you just talk all the time ?
that sounds interesting . i'll go with you tomorrow evening .
are you studying here ?
what are you major in ?
do you offer a course in business management ?
how many nights a week is it ?
and how long does the course last ?
when does it start ?
what time is the class ?
how much does it cost ?
yes , that's all right . i want to enroll in the course .
do you want me to fill it out now ?
finally the class is over . be quick . ben must have been waiting for long .
that's normal . you have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated .
no . you are just burning yourself out these days . have a good rest and you will feel energetic again .
how could he make such a silly mistake ?
he lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ?
come in , come in , what can i do for you ?
yes , i am applying on it .
aren't you a bit young ? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
well , if you think you are ready , i'll let you enroll .
are there many idioms in english ?
can you give us an example ?

three , you also should take two three credit course in education department .
are you studying any languages here ?
what are you majoring in ?
is it difficult to learn ?
do you know anything about britain and america ?
right . it ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well .
what do you like to do with your free time ?
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
studying english wouldn't give me any satisfaction . it ' s hard work .
margaret , do you think i should enroll in the science course ?
right , i figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .

is she your teacher ?
can she speak chinese to her students ?
what do you think of your teacher ?
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
miss fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the states ?
and do you have the letter of acceptance from the university with you ?
thanks very much . well , i'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is .
yes , it is a three year , but you can renew the visa each year in the states . it is our usual procedure .
our maths teacher is rather humorous .
no , not at all . his examples are really interesting .
bad luck , anne .
she's another antique .
hi , walter !
what do you think of our new teacher ?
you're got a point there . but do you think he's a little absent minded ?
i agree she had the right to say something , but i feel she should have done it privately .
why did the teacher criticise myra in front of the whole class ?
how are you getting along with your paper ?
you should hand it in before next sunday .
helen , you must be excited at going to america to study .
what do your classmates think of it ?
how long will you study there .
which university will you go to ?
good luck !
have you been in america long , hellen ?
where are you going to study ?
what are you going to major in ?
for nearly four years .
are you studying here ?
what are you majoring in ?
well , if you think you are ready , i'll let you enroll .
what courses are you going to take next year ?
why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ?
let's program your courses . since you have had english literature , you should take american literature and american prose and fiction . you transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so i don't think you have any problem with it .

i see . can i sit down ?
thank you , mr . johnson .
okay , tom .
she's upstairs in my room .
before we begin eating , i'd like to present everyone with a gift from taiwan .
it's a taiwanese puppet doll .
yeah . they're usually this big .
all the parts work .
mary , can you help me set the table ?
this is usually my chore .
we need to set the table for four .
that's right . mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you .
i don't think the teacher had a right to say that . the teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class .
i agree she had the right to say something , but i feel she should have done it privately .
our maths teacher is rather humorous .
no , not at all . his examples are really interesting .
yeah , how about your maths teacher ?
she's another antique .
don't talk too much , tom . we are on duty today , we should hurry up .
tom , your task is to clean the blackboard .
i'm going to sweep the floor first .

school has added several new courses to our grade this semester . i have more homework to do now .
i like science most .
i do like pe , but i am interested in science .
through this course , i can learn more about the world around us clearly .
naughty ? i'm naughty ? i'm just clever . so i only do the things i am interested in .
daniel , would you like to have a look at my dorm ?
it is a small room , just for 4 people .
it only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright .
of course . they are very friendly .
we are on the 5th floor , and there's a very nice view from the balcony .
yes , that's a good idea .

ok , let's go .
wonderful , bruce is taking the lead .
come on , bruce . come on , bruce .
could you please help me to check out the book ?
i can't remember that clearly . it probably be charles .
no , no , no . i'm not interested in literature .
oh , sorry . i'm always absent minded . i remember that i've put a note in my pocket .
i can't find it now .

excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ?
do you offer a course in business management ?
how many nights a week is it ?
and how long does the course last ?
do you want me to fill it out now ?

i'm a graduate student here in mathematics . i've just come from china and i've never used a western library before . i'll be here for five years , so i'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . i wonder if someone might have time to show me around .

you're just left school , haven't you , emily ?
you sound relieved .
well , what are you going to do now ? have you made any plans ?
you mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your a level subjects ?
in my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon .
actually , five and a half . on saturday , we have classes only in the morning .
that's too much for us really .
i'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
i'm going to register right now .
our maths teacher is rather humorous .
no , not at all . his examples are really interesting .

bad luck , anne .
she's another antique .
what do you think of your teacher ?
and i hear he gives very good lectures .
excuse me . where do i register ?
is that the large , white building ?
hi , lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again .
nothing special . i had a get together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
what's the matter ? you don't look well .
what about ?
oh , is that all ?
what do you hope to do when you finish university ?
after i graduate , i have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . i think i ’ ve got a good chance of passing . there ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in london , provide
if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored .
that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . you can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic .
how are you doing today ?
what do you need help with ?
have you looked in the periodicals ?
i can show you where they are .
that looks like an interesting book .
there are the pyramids . it ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ’ ve never been seen one that shape before .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they ’ re not perfectly cylindrical .
what sports do they play there ?
is that building a perfect cube ?
what book is that ?
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l
what can i do for you ?
i need your library card .
it seems you have late fees .
yes , i ’ m sure .
your late fees come to $ 24 . 50 .
you have to pay it off before you can check out more books .
do you have your library card ?
it appears that you have late fees .
yes , really .
you owe $ 24 . 50 in late fees .
i ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books .
what do you need ?
i ’ m going to need your library card .
why don ’ t you apply for one right now ?
please fill out this application .
now , sign your name on the back of the card .
here ’ s your library card .
what can i do for you ?
you can apply for one here .
if you like , you can apply right now .
i ’ m going to need you to complete this application .
then i will take your picture for your passport .
can you tell me where i can park ?
i drive an automobile .
yes , i have seen those signs .
yes , i know what the curb colors mean .
good morning . is this where i can get a library card issued to me ?
i'm done .
sure , here it is .
i am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ?
i see .
professor , i will not be here for our next class meeting .
i tried to work something out , but i really do have to miss one class .
i'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading .
yes , i remember .
sure , no problem .
excuse me , professor . i am going to miss next week's class .
i've made arrangements with a friend to help me .
yes , i know .
ok , i can do that .
i would like to register for a class today .
i would very much enjoy taking a psychology class . because i'm crazy .
which days are these classes on ?
what about the other class ?
are you sure there are no more open classes ?
sign me up for monday and wednesday .
yes , i can write that on my calendar .
yes , i understand .
no , i don't have a ride yet .
how much will the trip cost ?
i want to take a psychology class .
and the other class ?
are you sure these are the only open classes ?
okay , sign me up for the class on monday and wednesday .
could you help me to register for a class ?
are there any psychology classes available ?
can you tell me about the other class ?
you're positive that these are the only classes left ?
the class on monday and wednesday will be fine .
you spoken english is pretty good . please tell me your experience in learning english .
what's your method of learning ?
what if there is no chance ? i mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ?
could you help me ?
i can't seem to find my class .
it's in the c building .
do you think you can tell me where it is ?
it's room number 261 .
could you show me where it is ?
my german teacher thought it would be a good idea to have german pen friends to write to in german .
the only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in english .
that's right . and it's a b that i'll be writing too . her name is olga .
that's a great idea ! why didn't i think of that ?
i used to think that americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it .
yes . but now i ’ ve learned differently . now i have a more realistic opinion .
there are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . there is a high standard of living . people earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . so there isn ’ t so much money after all .
how long will it take to learn english ? will i be able to take other courses next semester or will english take up all of my time ?
you mean i could finish this course and still not know english ? you ’ ve got to be kidding !
so do we have to stay in this english class forever ?
so it ’ s really the same story . practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language .
how are you doing with your english language studies ?
is it harder than you thought ?
i have a real problem when i meet people .
i never know when to shake hands and when not to . can you tell me something about it ?
oh yes . men , women , and children shake hands all the time .
that sounds easy enough .
what do you think is harder , reading or writing ?
i don ’ t think i understand what you mean . could you explain a little more ?
oh , now i see what you mean . when you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !
i think i see what you mean . i can read shakespeare but i definitely can ’ t write it .
so i have another question for you . what do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ?
in what way ?
you are making me feel really discouraged .
i think a chinese student concentrates on written english , and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn .
they get higher level english , which is more formal than everyday spoken english . they also deal with matters of style and creativity .
absolutely not ! native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard english is spoken .
do you mind if i ask you a question ?
what do you do in order to improve your english ?
it ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ?
it takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ?
would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ?
so you will continue to study for a master's degree ?
how can you finance your education abroad ? it is very expensive to study abroad .
are you ok , chuck ? you look pale .
oh , poor you . you know what ? i found a new way to learn chinese and it works very well .
sure . i'm learning chinese through songs .
you can say that . i can actually sing some of them now .
i start by listening to the song a few times and after several times i am able to follow the singer .
it does . i've learned some chinese folk songs this way . they are clearly presented and easy to follow .
why not ? i downloaded a beautiful song the other day . we can learn it together now .
yes , just in case we run into me new characters .
how's your time spent in the united states ?
i'm glad to hear that . what impressed you most ?
you mean we chinese think differently from the americans ?
that's weird .
you really cared about your friend .
i'm confused . why did he say that ?
matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ?
no , i tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp i was a bit offended .
but she was in america ! shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in america signify confidence and respect ?
is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ?
how long have you been in america ?
do you think it's easy for a chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ?
have you adapted to the lifestyle in china ?
what ?
that makes you feel uncomfortable ?
perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
well , that's not rare . i've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
yeah .
pardon me . could you please pass me the tissue ?
thanks , i didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . are you ok ?
well , not every chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from sichuan and guizhou provinces can . back where i come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .
yeah , i guess that's a typical example of ' when in rome , do as the romans do . '
hi , my name is lean , and i'm from russia .
to me english is a difficult language .
true , but english is harder than most . it ' s a crazy language .
one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings .
do you speak only english in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish ?
i suppose she's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
what were you and richard talking about earlier ? it looked intense .
oh , no . i know how insensitive he can be . what has he done now ?
but , you were born and raised in california !
what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ?
so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ?
are you sure he really got the message ?
you know , i really don ’ t think americans are very romantic .
that ’ s the impression i get from the movies , and from looking around . men and women seem very business like in their relations with each other .
i just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . but go ahead .
ok , go on .
not exactly , but i see your point .
what do you like to do with your free time ?
you mean you like to study english ? why ?
studying english wouldn't give me any satisfaction . it's hard work .
yeah . it ’ s a lot better than mine .
eric , how long will you be in china ?
well , have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
don't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
it's where i teach you chinese , and in exchange you teach me english .
how about this sunday ?
are you studying any languages here ?
is it difficult to learn ?
well , you seem to enjoy speaking english .
i hope so . you see , at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . i'm awfully worried , i can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect .
are there many idioms in english ?
can you give us an example ?
what about the expression goodbye ? is that an idiom ?
here's the course description guide .
do you want me to help you ?
look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them .
you're catching on ! however , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics .
excuse me , i need your assistance .
i have no idea where my class is .
my class is in the c building .
do you mind telling me where it is ?
number 261 .
can you please show me ?
how are your chinese lessons going ?
well i guess you have fewer characters but i think chinese grammar is easier .
yes , i guess basic speaking in the english is easier .
how often do you have english lessons ?
how do you practice ?
do you ever speak to native speakers of english ?
do you mind helping me ?
i'm not sure how to find my next class .
could you point me in that direction ?
it's c261 .
can you show it to me ?
how do i buy my textbooks ?
yes , i have my list .
yes , i know where the bookstore is .
no , i didn't know i could do that .
yes , i am going today .
yes , thank you . that would be great .
where can i buy textbooks ?

i couldn't make it .

ok , i'd love the company .
yes , i will write that down .
yes , i will be there on time .
yes , someone is coming to get me .
what should we bring with us ?

maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
can we walk there ?
hi , could you help me find a place where i could buy some lunch ?
good ! where is it ?
that would be great .
i am not sure where the bookstore is .
yes , i knew i could do that . exactly how do i go about selling them ?
i think maybe i could be there .
maybe that would work .

i agree with you .
i need to find somewhere to park .
i need to find a space on campus .
where is the parking structure at ?
do you know if the parking structure is full or not ?
how long ago was that ?
do you think it'll be full now ?
i was wondering if you could help me to get a library card .
i'm finished .
no , i have no idea what they are .
i want to know how to buy something from this machine .
i want to buy one of those snack things .
i'm clear so far .

yes , next step .
i really need to find a parking spot .

i don't care about any of that .
would you talk to me about taking one of dr . miller's classes ?
i'm thinking about taking his class next semester .
i'm not sure because i really need to learn something , but i also worry about grades .
yes , that sounds right for me .
yeah , i already knew that . that could be a good thing .
professor , could i make an appointment with you ?
two o'clock would be the best time .

i see .
i'll see you then .
professor , can you help me add your class ?

i need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .

thanks , professor . i'll make sure everything gets taken care of .
what is the best place to park ?
i drive a motorcycle .
i am not sure what a handicapped spot is .
i park days and evenings .
what signs ?
what curb colors ?
i am a daytime student .
i will be driving my car .
i'll pay for it with a check .
no , thanks ; i'm fine .
well , i have a problem with my class schedule .
it seems that i've been given two classes scheduled at the same time .

yes , i do .
i only attend class part time in the evenings .
i have both , but i usually use my car to get to school .

no , thank you .
i want to buy a parking permit , please .
i attend both day and evening classes .

i have two classes on here that are at the same time .
can you change that for me ?
yes , i would like to keep both classes .
professor , do you have a few moments when i could meet with you ?
three would be a good time .
i'm not sure .
ok , i'll find it .
see you then .
i was supposed to meet with you at half past one .
there's a problem with my schedule .
is it at all possible for you to fix that error ?
excuse me , professor . i think there might be an error in my test score .
i think that the percentage is incorrect .
sure , let's do it .
i don't see any mistakes .
yes , you're right .
i was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher .
i think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right .
that would be great !
this one right here should be right .
yeah , let's do the math .
looks pretty good .
could we go over some things , because i think my test score is wrong .
both .
yeah , i'm ready .
these look strange .
ok , let's do the calculation .
i see .
i was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades .

do you grade on a curve or use percentages ?
what if we miss something ?
will you tell us if we are failing during the year ?
what do you base our grades on ?
does the final count the most ?
how do you total our scores ?
what if we are out sick ?
how can we know if we are doing ok during the year ?
i'd like to talk to you about my grades .

professor , i'm concerned about my grades . do you have a minute ?

i have to get an belts score of 7 . 5 overall . do you think i can do that ?
i was also accepted into yale university , and sydney university .
i just can't decide where to go . it's not an easy decision to make .

you look better today . how did your test go ?
did you pass ?
you should be . you worked really hard last night preparing for it .
you don't have to thank me . it's just a part of my job as your counsellor .
no , in fact , i was terrible at taking exams .
sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that i could and that helped me a lot . when are your final exams ?
when do you plan on studying for those exams ?
do you think that's a good idea ?
that sounds like a good idea . what are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ?
how was school today , dominic ?

why didn't you do a good job ?
do you think you studied enough for the exam ?
what did you do last night ?
did you study at all last night for your exam ?
i am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . when can you re take your exam ?
hi , charlie ! what are you reading ?
who ’ s it about ?
who is he ?
who ’ s the author ?
can i read it when you ’ re done ?

when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ?
thanks . charlie !
you look hot and tired . jack , have you been exercising ?
who won ?
what was the score ?
what are you specializing in ?
that sounds really interesting . can you speak swahili ?
really ? how did you do that ?
that's amazing . are you doing well in your classes ?
how do you think you did ?
i'm sure you'll do well . did you study hard ?
what do you think of the test ?
it wasn't too bad . were you nervous ?
oh , i wouldn't worry about it .
no , i wouldn't worry about you .
are you looking for a course ?
what kind of program are you looking for ? full time or part time ?
what kind of course are you looking for ?
do you want a one to one private tutor or a group class ?
that's fine . if you want , you can sign up for a pre sessional interview .
one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best .
did you go to university ?
when did you graduate ?
i just graduated from high school .
i'd like to get a ba , but i don't know where i should go .
yes , i've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them .
the tuition is the same for all of them .
i think the course at leeds university is interesting , but i think the one at manchester university would be more practical .
i'd really like to be in london , but it's the most expensive city in england to live in , so i don't know if i can afford to live there .
not yet .
that's a good idea .
can i see your passport , please ?
yes it is . residents can queen up in the lines to my right .
what's the expiration date on your passport ?
i see . yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the uk .
do you have anything to declare ?
how long will you be staying in the uk ?
what is the purpose of your stay ?
where will you be staying ?
how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ?
ok . have a good day . here's your passport and documents back .
what are you so ticked off about ?
maybe i could help .
you've got be joking .
fine . how are your term papers ?
how could it be ? they are due two weeks later .
kate , you know , i am thinking of getting a part time job next year because i really need more money and i don't want to ask my parents for any more . but i'm so busy ! how am i going to work and study
jenny , you look terrible . what's eating you ?
hey , chillon , i'm just trying to help .
so , what's the problem ?
no kidding ! didn't you study for it ?
that's too bad , anyway , i'm sure things will turn around next master .
you can't do that , jenny !
do you want to attend the convocation ?
do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ?
no . those you have to provide for yourself .
it doesn't matter . say'cheese ' .
why are you so upset today , maria ? cheer up !
it ’ s a great opportunity . you should be happy with the offer .
why ? it ’ s unfair . you can learn a lot from it .
i agree with you but i think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind .
just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . and more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job .
sure . every cloud has its silver lining . just try .
i'll always remember my college days .
it was one of the best times in my life . it was tough , but i made it . i became a college graduate .
it was a round day for me . my family attend the graduation ceremony . i was so nervous . i couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end .
i was planning to attend gradate school , but then i was offered a good job doing marketing , so i changed my mind .
i sure am . so what about you ? how did you feel when you graduated ?
you didn't have an offer ?
you'll soon graduate from your university . do you have any plans for the future ?
do you have a clear career path to follow ?
what kind of job do you want after graduation ?
wait ! you can't do so many things at the same time . what exactly do you want ?
yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal .
no , you can't waste your time wandering around . if you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working
how was your education going on in australia ?
where are you going to work then , in australia or back in china ?
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
yeah , china's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country .
the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags amd head for home .

all right .
these magazines are interesting . may i borrow one ?
i'm going to work in a multi national enterprise after graduation .
i'll do it someday . but it's not the right time now . i have to learn a lot by working as an employee .
you could say so . i'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise .
yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . and their customers may become the potential ones for my own company .
well , i'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors .
hello ! how are you today ?
it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers .
let ’ s go and get a coffee together . that will help you to wake up again !
oh , you know me . i ’ m always happy ! if i think i ’ m getting into a bad mood , i call some friends and socialize or have a chat .
why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ?

we ’ re going to the bookshop . would you like to join us ?
me too . i need something to read on the flight to new york . i can never sleep on planes . sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .
what are you doing ?
there are no countries marked on the map .
rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you .
are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ?
is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ?
are the reports favorable ?
that ’ s interesting . they must be thinking of moving into that market . are there any interesting editorials ?
i ’ m not surprised . that article certainly added fuel to the debate . ok . thanks . can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? i ’ d like to read them .
i see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . are there any interesting articles in it ?
i like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
you know . tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ?
of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . according to the jealousy test , i ’ m quite a jealous type of person . perhaps i need to control my jealousy .
do you buy that newspaper every day ?
is there a sunday edition of that newspaper ?
what section does it have ?
what ’ s in that section ?
it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language .
does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english speaking world ?
i can ’ t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
but it ’ s so old .
no , not at all .
why does he want to do that ?
won ’ t they get his inheritance ?
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .
there ’ s movie ? my teacher didn ’ t tell me that !
it would take a lot less time
what are you reading about in that science magazine ?
i ’ m not sure i like the idea of that . i don ’ t want people copying me or other people . it could be very confusing .
in the future , that could be possible .
really ? what else have you discovered ?
hi cody , how did practicing go this week ?
great ! warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . good , good . this week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . now let ’ s take a look at this
it might work . i ’ ll have to hear it . show me what you ’ ve done .
it ’ s just nerves . just play the right hand for now . one two three four five six , ta ti tri ple ti . good , good . don ’ t forget the accidentals ! the key signature says that note should be a g sharp b
yes , much better . watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . what was that ?
hey ! how was your first day of class ? i ’ m in level two and i ’ m loving my class this semester ! it ’ s great being in a class of international students !
that ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . it ’ s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans , a pole , a scottish , two french , an american , a brazilian ,
well , i think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . you ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
don ’ t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
hey , joe ! where have you been these past few days ?
cool ! i ’ ve always wanted to do something like that ! have you learned anything useful ?
have you treated any real emergencies ?
excuse me ? is this where i register ? i ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester .
here you are .
yes . i do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .
yeah . here ’ s my list . i ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though .
what ’ s up ? you don ’ t look too good .
i liked physics . it ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .
a physics class about the creation of the universe ? that ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . sounds more religious to me .
there is evidence ! you know edwin hubble ? he ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . what would it be expanding from ? well , the big bang . duh !
alright everyone settle down . let ’ s get started . as you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . it is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . this brings me to our topic for today . does anyone know what we celebrate on may first ?
no , that ’ s may fifth in spanish , james , no wonder you are failing my spanish class . no , may first is international workers ’ day .
no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is .
in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250 , 000 workers were involved in the may day movement . previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect .
yes ! but the happy ending came at a high price . on may third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the mccormick reaper works factory , killing four and wounding many . a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
that ’ s right ! we apply cpr in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .
well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! that ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . let ’ s begin ! i need a volunteer .
alright , come here and lay flat on your back . let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . we must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this .
as i was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . to do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times .
what school would you like to go to ?
you honestly have no idea ?
you might as well stay here .
pcc is a wonderful institution .
so , what are you going to do ?
you got a letter in the mail .
what is it ?
what does it say ?
are you serious ?
good for you !
stop running around in front of the tv , will you ? why don't you just sit and watch ?
then stay away . no one is keeping you from doing that .
all right , i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
i'm so angry . i feel like killing someone .
you got a letter in the mail .
what does it say ?
are you all right ?
i was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night .
kate . she said she was too excited to go to sleep .
it ’ s true . guess what we were talking about last night .
yeah , how do you know about that ?
hey john . i have some great news .
i got a job offer from dell .
i thought i did bad on the interview , but i guess i was wrong . i'm so happy right now .
thanks . i feel like celebrating . let's go have a beer . it's on me .
i heard you're getting married , james . congratulations !
who ’ s the letter from ?
read it !
really ?
i ’ m so happy for you !
i am really proud of you .
i work so hard that i do not have the energy to exercise .
but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet , i am still getting fatter .
i know you're right , but what can i do ?
but i'll miss the news . it ' s important in my business to keep up with events in china .
this man looks very handsome . is he married ?
oh , i can't believe it . he looks very young .
i got the job you recommended me for last week .
i really don't know how i can thank you enough .
he has so many friends supporting him .
to be frank , i find philosophy rather boring .
you seem to be very hesitant about doing things .
you are meeting trouble halfway , i guess .
i'm afraid of the darkness .
do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ?
oh , but why ?
my son has really taken it out of me . he never keeps out of mischief .
that's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
and why are you yarning now ? are you bored ?
the operation was very successful .
the answer is zero ! what a let down !
no hard feelings . after all , he is a child .
i like the design of the coat .
anyway , it's my ideal coat . i'll take it .
i prefer potatoes to eggplants .
on balance , dress designing appeals to me most .
say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?
i've had enough of that !
i hate the hero . he ' s too cruel .
i am tired of everything in my life .
you don ’ t know that i have been over protected by my mother these years . i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings .
yes , my customers have started to complain too !
i seldom heard the quarreling of her children .
because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long .
i feel so uncomfortable .
no . the teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . it set my teeth on edge .
i don't think the lecture is very interesting .
i feel he's like a talking machine .
i wish you would not be so selfish .
but you should at least consider your son's future .
peter is a bag lady now .
he was so rich in the past . maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now .
mark is parade his knowledge again .
saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits .
that ’ s too much .
the trouble is not that . it is that he may suddenly remember something i promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . then he complains that i have gone back on my words .
he never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him .
he brings with him some talented people from his former city .
mary is really a diligent girl .
she learns to speak latin by osmosis within three months .
what are you thinking about ?
again !
it ’ s over .
our relationship . i mean my friend and i .
i'm busy year in and year out , but now i've done nothing .
i may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction .
my son came home from three years in the navy .
he's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death .
bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly .
but don't forget you are in a cafe .
i simply can't bear your barbaric behavior .
you should feel shameful for your behavior .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
i spend all my time looking after my baby . i'm so tired .
it really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . i even want to wring his neck .
i can't forget it .
david , i ’ m going to china .
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
thank you . i ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
i ’ m sure i will .
mike ! look at the floor !
it's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
well , they ' re not here . they are in the dustbin .
oh !
to think of it ! all my old silver ! it meant so much to me .
i'll never get over it . oh , harry , it was all so unnecessary . that man ! ! how could he do this to us after we'd put him up ?
what's up ? you look low .
how come ?
i understand that . but i think maybe it's not a date . you are taking the matter too much to heart .
i am confused by what he said .
i don ’ t know what he wants to do . does he want help me or just scold me ?
you are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ?
are you sure ?
just because he gets on well with everybody ?
this small town has many serious problems .
the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions .
joan is a thorough drag !
she keeps talking when i'm reading .
finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . and trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at .
you are passing the buck . i'll be hanged if i ask you to go to the park with us .
you seem to be in the seventh heaven . what's put you on ?
did she give up her decision to marry dick ?
didn't joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ?
if i were him , i wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money .
i ’ m just coming for that .
she ’ s your sister . what she asked was only duck soup for you . why can ’ t you be good to her ?
look ! the girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . she is lovely .
what makes you think so ?
he has a long head , i bet he will do well in his business .
when we were students , he was no good in any subject .
quite a few times , i had my back to the wall .
that ’ s right .
my granny is such a kind hearted person . she is willing to help .
sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . when can you find a job .
your ring is very beautiful .
oh , it is precious .
i have a bone to pick with you .
you always have a chip on your shoulder .
what do you think of his behaviour yesterday ?
i'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow .
as a teacher , i don ’ t know how to help him .
don ’ t be worried . please sit down and take it easy .
but you should avoid finger pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts .
my hair stood on end when i saw the bloody scene .
my father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold .
that ’ s really a let down .
but that should not be the reason for you to lose heart .
jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back .
can you imagine a boat letting in the river ?
our house is too small . we had better have a big one .
it ’ s really terrible !
don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
what is wrong with your face ?
why ?
he has come to life in the end .
yes . fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital .
why do you look so sad ?
why not go and see a doctor ?
what an attractive blouse , you look so pretty in this blue dress !
it's very nice . it goes well with your skirt .
not at all . this dress certainly shows your good taste .
i ’ m itching for moving !
hi .
yeah ?
yeah ?
oh , i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry , i i didn't realize it was that loud .
oh , it's no problem . it ' s ok . you know , it only happened once .
how do you do , prof . smith .
thank you . i begin to like english even when i was a child .
at school , in china . this is my first time to be out of my own country .
what's happening in your life ?
that sounds great .
you're late .
my phone ?
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes , it's dead . there's no dial tone .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i don't have a phone . oh , what can i do ?
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it isn't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes , i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here . but if not , i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it ' s very important to me .
can i borrow some money from you ?
hi ! wang mei . come and have a look at my new dress .
thank you for saying so .
i bought it in a store near my school .
it's only thirty yuan .
doris , i'm glad you're home . i'm terrified . i don't know what to do !
i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring . he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop .
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too .
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
he followed me all the way home !
yes , he was . i'm not imagining it . finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he didn't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i'm so scared . can i call the police ?
i suppose . what can they do ? i don't even know who he is .
ah ! no ! damn it !
so what ? i just lost one hour's worth of work .
no , i didn't save this time . damn it ! and i'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too .
i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they're worth .
i don't know . i feel like going out .
it doesn't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer .
yes , that's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper , and now i can't even do my homework . this is a bad time for this to happen .
i got a raise .
congratulations ! is it a boy or a girl ?
congratulations ! you've just won a car !
bob , i'm really upset with you .
mary , be calm .
no , listen to me . i always regard you as my best friend . i admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . i should thank you .
no , listen to me . perhaps it's my fault that i treat everybody so well . maybe in other people's eyes , i want you to be my girl friend . but . but .
ok . ok . anyway . i will treat you as my best friend . i hope you can do the same .
is your lady beautiful ? since i came here from the country , i've not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?
and , her lips ?
and her voice like a lark's song ?
oh , she sings too ?
how could you have done that without asking me first ?
well , you should have thought .
oh , you look stunning . your dress really goes well with your shoes .
no , not at all . it looks really classy on you . where did you pick that up ?
when did you go there ?
i was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .
you're my hero .
hey , cindy , i'm so sorry about yesterday . i shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone .
i don't know what happened to me . i just lost it .
i really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away .
then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ?
i don't want to argue anymore . please get out of my life !
no way ! please don't follow me around .
i couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful !
no , miss anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! what's wrong with that ?
you know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ?
guess what i've brought for you .
i hope you like it .
i'm sorry , but i can't find the book you lent me .
i must apologize . i'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
i'm terribly sorry . won't you let me pay for it ?
i'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
hey matt . i just got a job at a consulting firm .
i'm so happy . i don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .
i start next monday .
yeah . i'm going to celebrate tonight . wanna hang out ?
of course . how about toby ? should we call him ?
i should still tell him . in the least , i can refer him to my company . it might help .
hi , mr . smith . what's new ?
what's the matter ?
go ahead . it's nothing serious . we are good friends , aren't we ?
i simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish eye when i knew all that .
however , he disappointed us very much this time .
what's the matter , john ? you seemed to be restless today .
oh , that's easy . if it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . that's my advice .
then what about the salary ? would you get more ?
have you discussed it with your wife ?
as i say it the work is well worth try . after all you can get a higher salary .
jack i hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . is that right ?
don't hesitate . that's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain .
but this chance is really precious .
i hope you can make a clever choice . anyway , the opportunities around you are not that by .
i don't want to do the damn dishes .
the teacher should give us more time to complete this assignment .
i wish i knew who had moved our flower pots .
what did you think you were doing ?
how dare you be so inconsiderate ? that's wrong .
never do that again .
look at that pretty girl .
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
but you should tell me you were in love with her .
you know you didn't .
yes , but you might have told me before .
you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
tom , i won first prize in the poetry contest .
really ! here's my trophy .
are you listening to me , dan ?
that's a cool jacket . where did you get it ?
i'm really sorry , bob . i accidentally damaged your bike .
that's a very nice pair of glasses .
you seemed to be fed up with mary .
she is a barking dog . but she means well .
you look like being on cloud nine .
what has made you so happy ?
are you ? who's the lucky girl ?
how did you meet her ?
i guess it was fate working to bring you together .
i dislike susan . she is always above herself .
what of it ?
hello , dora , i haven't seen you for a long time . where have you been ?
oh , i know . sometimes i have the same feeling with you . but you'd better not be so emotional .
sure , no problem . you can call me any time you are alone from now on .
anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! the color goes with your trousers perfectly .
well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . it must have cost a lot .
really ? you're an amazing bargain hunter ! next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you .
what a beautiful sweater !
yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants .
i love that vase .
yes , it looks perfect .
well , a good teacher makes good students .
i like your new skirt .
yes . it looks terrific !
i think luck played a very small part in your victory . it is solely due to your hard work and efforts . that brings honor to you and joy to us .
it is real word .
i hear that you have been promoted . congratulations on your promotion !
when are you going ?
i have just had my new paper published .
i have been accepted by oxford university on phd .
i wish you wouldn't play the tv so loud .
yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time .
i just heard that you won the long distance race . congratulations on your victory .
so it is really worth your great effort . and hope you can keep the record you've made today .
you don't have to play that record so loud , do you ?
yes . and please ask me the next time you want to use something .
yes . and something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking .
i've got a complaint about the noise next door .
some people aren't very considerate .
we'll play the cd loud , is that all right ?
what should we do ?
do you think you could keep the noise down ?
yes . and another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ?
mike , did you win the lottery or something ? why the big smile ?
did you tell your parents yet ?
they're probably going to be so happy .
hello ?
i was just watching tv . what's going on with you ?
i remember that . it was a great movie . but it was definitely scary .
sure . i can come over . what should we do ?
ok . i'll get ready and leave . i'll see you in about 20 minutes .
don't worry , nothings going to happen . i'll be there real soon .
hello , mary . what ’ s the matter with you ? you look upset .
oh , i ’ m sorry to hear that . i know how you feel . please don ’ t be sad .
you seem really ticked off . what's up ?
well , now you're really going to freak out when i tell you who aced it . what's her face . the one who always kisses up to the teacher .
i'm dead serious . yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to mr edward's desk and goes , ‘ good morning , jim . ’
guess what ? i won the speech contest at my school .
jack , what's wrong ?
what are you talking about ? what did i do ?
no . that's not what i meant . i didn't mean that . she asked me where you were and i jokingly said that you were on a date with sara . i thought martha knew that you and sara were just friends .
i'm sorry i'm late .
the bus i took .
i took the wrong bus .
is there anything i can do for you ?
where is she going to college ?
really ? that's the icing on the cake . congratulation again !
here's your drink , sir .
oh , i'm terribly sorry , sir . i'll go and get you cola right away .
yes , sir . i'll bring your drink right away .
is there , sir ? i'm very sorry . i'll change it straight away .
david , why don't you clean your room ?
why are you feeling depress ?
i don't think she would do such a thing .
oh , cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
then forgive her mistake .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
no , seriously . i am impressed .
no , seriously . i am impressed .
hello , joanna . you are looking very charming in the new dress .
yes , it suits you very well . it certainly is unique . i don ’ t think i ’ ve seen anything like it before .
and the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously .
morning , peter . nice suit ! a new one ?
maybe . several people have suggested that i get more yellow clothes . they say the color suits me because i have a fair complexion .
excuse me . have you forgotten our drinks ?
there is something wrong with this dish .
i don't think this is fresh .
you ’ re making my blood boil .
sorry isn ’ t good enough ! what can you do to help me ?
well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough !
look what you've done !
yes , and hurry up !
no , i'll do it myself .
yes , and please be more careful in the future !
i've come to apologize for what i said yesterday .
i must make an apology for losing my temper .
you received a letter in the mail .
who ’ s the letter from ?
i want to know what it says .
are you serious ?
are you okay ?
i am really sorry to hear that .
excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ?

i want to study abroad .
i hope to study english literature .
not yet . i have an interview with a visa official today .
there ’ s a letter here for you .
what ’ s the letter about ?
tell me what it says !
you ’ re lying .
are you upset ?
ok class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ?
that's right , the brain ! it serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . then what major organ is in our chest ?
very good ! it pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! now what about the organs that help us digest food ?
very good ! let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . are we forgetting anything ?
oh yes , you are right . very important organs indeed .
hey stacy . what's going on ?
why ? you're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
how about your husband . does he help much ?
that sucks .
that's crossing the line .
excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ?
thanks !
i want to study abroad .
i hope to study english literature .
not yet . i have an interview with the visa official today .
no , i've already been to here for three interviews .
i was denied a visa ?
like most students . i want to work in america after graduation .
guess what came in the mail today ?
freshman orientation is the last week of august , but i want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .
yes . i ’ ll be very busy ! i have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . but first , i want to register for classes .
well , they sent me their prospectus , so i can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ?
well , i have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major .
i hope to major in english literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see .
in order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , english , philosophy , science and art .
yes , it is . it ’ s also very different from the british education system .
oh , sure . in british , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course .
what's this then ?
but this should have been handed in last thursday .
well , what's your excuse then ?
oh , yes ?
ok . come back into the classroom , class .
yes , but to the health , this break has long enough .
come on , baby . it ’ s time now .
i give up ! i simply can't learn french !
no , i'm not . i try and try and i still can't speak it very well .
are you an american ?
why don't you speak english ?
oh , do you like chinese ?
does she make any sense to you ?
she's speaking french , not greek .
me neither . all i have to do is study french hard .
are you a newcomer ?
you speak good english , though .
but let me tell you , you're doing just fine . i couldn't do half as well as you do when i was learning german . by the way , how long have you been learning english ?
are you new here ?
is this your first year in college ?
which school ?
how do you like it here compared to pcc ?
do you like it better here or at pcc ?
you must be new .
have you just started college ?
what school ?
do you like it here ?
do you like it better here or at pcc ?
if that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ?
you ’ re new here , right ?
will this be your first year ?
what school did you come from ?
why ’ d you transfer here ?
is pcc a good school ?
i hope you enjoy it here .
are you ready to transfer tomorrow ?
you ’ re not nervous ?
what are you most nervous about ?
you shouldn ’ t be nervous about that .
meeting new people is a good thing .
are you new to this school ?
is this your first year in college ?
where did you transfer from ?
why did you transfer ?
did you like it at pcc ?
well , i wish you luck here .
you ’ re new here , right ?
is this your first semester ?
what school did you transfer from ?
do you like it here so far ?
which is better , here or pcc ?
are you new here ?
are you a freshman in college ?
what school did you transfer from ?
what made you transfer ?
did you like pcc ?
good luck here .
where are you planning on transferring to ?
where do you want to go ?
you haven ’ t thought about it ?
why don ’ t you just continue going to pcc ?
it ’ s a great school .
so , have you made your decision yet ?
you ready ?
are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ?
you ’ re not nervous , are you ?
why are you nervous ?
that ’ s not a problem .
it ’ s fun meeting new people .
have you figured out where you want to transfer to ?
where would you like to go to school ?
you can ’ t think of anything ?
so , why don ’ t you just stay here ?
it ’ s a perfectly good school .
do you know what you ’ re going to do now ?
what a washing machine ! it ’ s getting worse today . look ! now it doesn ’ t work at all . i think i need a new one .
watch out ! you'll hit that car if you're not careful .
you see . i told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful .
hey sarah , are you all right ? you look upset .
what happened ?
well , i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes .
what was the meeting about ?
it's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient .
you have to keep things short and sweet . when you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details .
you can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . not everyone needs to know all that information .
oh , no !
look at the view from the window .
it ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ?
well , i guess zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room .
i got your e mail a couple of months back .
the one that said , you're a creep . from me you won't hear another peep . i hope you wreck your jeep .
i'm going for a walk , yi jun . i need some time to myself .
i just can't right now . everyone will be talking about taylor and .
i need to come to grips with his death first . and i also need to prepare a eulogy in case i'm asked to speak tomorrow .
hey sandra , what's wrong ? you look furious !
but sandra . you love your job ! you spent months trying to get this position . it's perfect for you !
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
i had a worker like that once . she was always taking credit for my ideas .
oh , no . it looks like we're late .
there're so many people here . where are rich and cath and taylor's parents ?
hurry up ! time is money !
but you are too slow to follow them .
what do you think of the new television channel ? aren't the programs awful ?
actually , what bothers me is the violence . there are far too many detective and police shows .
wedding rings !
aren't they cool ? i like the settings .
no . i just like looking at wedding rings , ok ?
what happened ?
hi joe . you met my new assistant , right ?
you are kidding , but she's so helpful .
come on . she's like that with everyone .
cheers ! to our first night in our new apartment .
all you hear is the crickets and the breeze .
well , i think it's fabulous . and the neighbors don't even seem to exist .
i've been standing here since half past seven . where on earth have you been ?
wow ! what happened to you ? you look sad .
that's unbelievable . why did this happen ?
harry was angry last night .
he got the scholarship to harvard .
it's true . he is a hard worker .
i don't like this movie . it's a bomb .
how could you have the heart to kill it ? we only have one !
thank you so much for coming tonight . everybody really enjoyed your performance .
here's the check . i included a little extra for you .
the boss announces the pay raise today , right ? how much do you think we'll get ?
it better be more than last year .
what do you think about violence in movies ?
but kids like watching things like that . it's just for fun , would't you say ?
i'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title .
why not ?
i feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
i agree , i had lunch there last week .
too much , harry . don't blame her anymore .
i know . but there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?
you won one million yuan in a lottery . what will you say ?
i understand . it's too good to be true , isn't it ?
yes , he's really pushed me too far .
i'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug .
but i ruined your rug .
you didn't tell me she was married !
i got carried away . i made such a fool of myself . they were both laughing at me !
that guy was definitely a don .
yeah . if i leave little italy alive .
is there something wrong ? you look so sad .
no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ?
did bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? look !
no wonder he asked for my address first he just wants to harass me !
hello . i was wondering if taylor smith has checked out yet ?
the cancer ward ! ? oh , my . it's worse than we thought .
that's impossible ! i'm talking about mister taylor smith .
it seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you .
this has been the worst and best day of my life , taylor . they kept you in the hospital , and .
but you're ok ? it was nothing serious , was it ?
you know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ?
i sent out a notice . you've stopped checking your e mail ?
how obnoxious ! i heard he was sending you dirty jokes .
but you're not to blame for them keeping him there .
i'm not sure , but we can find out . i bought some crosswords to keep him busy .
sorry ! excuse me ! i got your message .
that's ok . just let it out . i'm ok ! i was out of town with . femi .
i don't know what to say . this can't be happening . here's the obituary .
this says the viewing is at myers funeral home today until five .
did everyone fill out their entry permits ?
speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . i wonder why .
that's because it's time .
it's time to make our wedding wish come true .
why not ? i've got the rings ready .
are you ready to go to the mall ?
copycat !
you went out and bought khakis , too !
brooke , are you still mad ? is your mom mad ?
it will be . and today is , too . i just talked to the airlines .
no , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in .
you got it ! we'll fly there directly from texas .
whew ! i had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .
wow ! your calligraphy is very beautiful . it was worth the wait !
what does it say ?
really ? then what do you do with it ?
wow ! really ? are you sure ? now i'll have a lucky year !
nicole , your fettucini is very . unique .
actually , it's better .
no . it was the only dish she wasn't good at . so we could use you as the new head chef .
thanks for helping me up .
i'm the hazardous one here . i made three people fall over !
i'm so humiliated ! what's that man saying ? everyone's laughing !
does mr . schmidt know he's going to become a father ?
what ? i don't get it .
well , i'm glad i made everyone happy .
i'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . ha ha .
kim ! i'm here ! i brought all my old maternity clothes plus dave and alice's baby clothes !
believe me , the time will fly by ! before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! you have to start preparing !
did you go to the movie yesterday ?
what did you think of it ?
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
i can't think the same .
excuse me , supen .
please forgive me , but i have to leave . i feel terrible . but .
my daughter isn't feeling well .
i don't know . will you forgive me ?
thank you . it's our first date . i hope it's not too offensive .
congratulations on your success .
and how ’ s your brother ?
he ’ s going to be sent to britain to study , really ?
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
you didn't ring me last night . you said you would .
that's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ?
i don't agree with you . it's too small to live .
i disagree , a big town is more lively .
what a great weekend that was !
i really enjoy the beach in the summer .
we should come here more often .
i'd like to come back next weekend .
i ’ m so excited , mother . oh , a new baby !
and my first nephew . he looks a lot like you , mum . he does .
yes , he does have richard ’ s eyes . the baby even looks like you than richard does .
it ’ s true . michelle is a lot like henry in so many ways . and she is shy with new people just like he is .
you are studying here , aren ’ t you ?
do you like this campus ?
how come ?
oh . it ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped .
david , i ’ m going to china .
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
thank you . i ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
i ’ m sure i will .
david , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?
i don ’ t think she will do such a thing .
oh , cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
then forgive her mistake .
you ’ re all set now ?
i was happy to help .
don ’ t mention it .
you look so happy , anna . any good news ?
really ? congratulations !
by the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? tomorrow is my birthday .
not so soon . it ’ s not my birthday today . well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?
gordon , you're ever so late .
but there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late .
oh , come on , gordon , it's the afternoon now . why were you late really ?
have you got it now ?
when ?
would you like to see our new shirts ?
but they ’ re very nice , you know .
and not expensive either .
everybody is buying them .
yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see .
i see .
how about a movie tonight ?
does 7 o'clock suit you ?
how about a snack after work ?
would you rather stay home ?
are you really interested in doing something ?
we ’ re going to the movies . will you join us ?
then would you like to have lunch with us ?
come on . it ’ s no trouble at all .
you don ’ t look like enjoying this workout .
you don ’ t like this sort of exercise ?
yes , that ’ s funny . i thought you liked it .
never mind . it ’ ll be over in 10 minutes .
what's the matter with you then ? you look miserable .
what do you mean by us .
that's right .
i . i . i miss my parents , also they miss me .
you mean i am groaned a few words ?
it may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing .
in times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . but his whole family was here .
and he was so young , with so much life to look forward to .
hey , mary , can you cut that out ?
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it ’ s driving me crazy .
i don ’ t slurp my coffee . and plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?
look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up i ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
i have a problem .
my mattress was supposed to be delivered today .
the delivery people showed up four hours late .
i was late for work because of them .
i want my money back for the delivery .
i'm sorry , ladies . mr . smith's viewing is over . it ended an hour ago .
i'm sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock .
the mosquitos are biting me !
then we ’ ll have to put up with it .
that ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ ve had ! let ’ s do it !
hi , daniel , how are you holding up ? i am greatly sorry for your loss .
how ’ s that going ?
have you bought a burial plot and a casket ?
i see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . i am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . you are doing a great job .
dan , dan , dude . you have to come over to my house right now !
just get over here !
so , since when is your house a bank ?
i mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows .
what ’ s the matter with you ? why are you acting all paranoid ?
ok , well , what did you want to see me about ?
our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . i ’ ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off .
then what shall i do ?
why are you so rude to your wife ?
but she means to help you , not to trouble you .
jenny , what's wrong with you ? why do you keep weeping like that ?
it smells like an ashtray in here !
what ’ s wrong ? i thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .
look , there are other ways to quit . you can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . we spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . it ’ s not like you can just light up like before .
don't cover up your sadness . let it go .
it isn't your fault . no one will blame you .
when i quarrel with my husband . he didn't even try to cool me out .
i think that ’ s settled .
how dare you speak to me like this .
you are blue in the face , arn't you ?
my son is alway complaining that i dump on him . he was very rude and told me to mind my own business . i cannot put up with that .
it ’ s really terrible !
don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
what are you thinking about ?
again !
finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . and trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at .
you are passing the buck . i'll be hanged if i ask you to go to the park with us .
fred is really a good guy . and he loves you so much .
he's after your own heart , it is important .
john's father got married again .
if i tell you . , you must be completely taken aback .
he married a girl who is only eighteen !
i didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful .
you seem to be in the seventh heaven . what's put you on ?
did she give up her decision to marry dick ?
are you an american ?
why don't you speak english ?
i want to study german . can we exchange lessons ?
when will we begin ?
but i always feel disappointed . i have many problems with english learning .
i feel confused about the grammars .
and my writing is not good . i feel so frustrated .
i give up ! i simply can't learn french !
no , i'm not . i try and try and i still can't speak it very well .
i don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit .
if i were li na , i would ask her if she had done that .
what do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ?
nothing . just that i don't care for these carrots . hi , sis . , i saw you buy some chocolate cakes . i am done with the main course . it's about time for some dessert .
no , no , i'm just thinking of some dessert . and i have had enough carrots .
i know , but chocolate cake is even better .
wow , the view from the peak is so grand !
did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ?
but my father did not . he didn't have much time .
really ? it's a deal . have you ever been there ?
it really gets me interested . is it higher than kiang shan ?
can i see the rainbow ?
what courses are you taking ?
what do you think about the teachers ?
that's too bad . do you have any foreign teachers ?
what is he like ?
oh , that's good ! he sounds like a good teacher .
john , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? the lawn needs weeding .
well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . come and help me in the kitchen .
would you like to clear the table then ?
not , if you don ’ t want to .
do you love me ?
yes , but do you love me ?
why didn ’ t you answer my question ?
do you love me ? come on , i ’ m eager to hear .
don ’ t cherish your words , dear .
who did the stupid thing ?
i don't think so . dick has been on the ball and never does things like that .
how did jim get the money ?
he must be mad ! nick is a loan shark .
oh , my god . i can't take it any more .
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it's so terrible .
yes , that's in the past . maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help .
i was full of ambitions before . but now i have no aim for my career .
a training course ? that must be costly .
ok , let's have a try .
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
you know you didn't .
yes , but you might have told me before .
you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
would you like a cup of coffee ?
oh , no .
this machine is out of order .
i sure did .
how was the movie last night ?
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
she liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
how's your new car ?
you made a good choice , then ?
no regrets ?
do you know who ’ s just got married ? old mc donald .
he ’ s nearly 90 .
i am . whatsmore , his wife is 84 .
yes , she is . and guess what , he is her sixth husband .
listen to this . mary got married .
yes . yesterday .
she married jerrod .
she ’ s going to live in paris .
i just had a terrible week .
i fell down and hurt my arm .
then my son drove into a tree
the dog bit the delivery boy .
and a storm blew our roof away .
i've just got the examination results . i am afraid you haven't passed .
don't worry about that , i am sure they will understand . after all , it was a very difficult exam .
are you elvin ?
i'm mary . i want to say i really admire the software you're designed .
it is ?
are you still mad about your nose ? how is it ?
that won't be necessary , elvin . look , i want to apologize for your nose . i'm sorry .
you're being childish . your nose will heal . and so will your pride , if you let it .
don't know what ?
is that right ? like what kind of changes ?
just remember . the main thing right now is to make sure stars . com is happy .
how are zina's new programmers working out ?
so you'll make the stars . com deadline , and have us up and running next week ?
good . after stars . com starts paying us , we won't need vikam's cash anymore .
do you think what i did to elvin was out of line ?
elvin doesn't want any programming help . he wants all the glory for himself .
did you hear the names he was calling me ?
she promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the stars . com web site by the end of next week .
yes , i think she is just a little bit crazy .
what do you think of the new television channel ? aren't the programs awful ?
actually , what bothers me is the violence . there are far too many detective and police shows .
i'm afraid i've had a terrible row with my boss . what shall i do ?
oh , but i can't . it wasn't my fault .
all right . but these are black and i don ’ t like black shoes . they ’ re dull .
then why are you wearing black shoes ?
could i see the manager please ? i have a complaint to make .
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
what ? how could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
my goodness . she is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race .
a chinese girl have broken the world record in the olympic games
you have to . it's sure .
you didn't ring me last night . you said you would .
that's all right . but why were you so rude to me at lunch .
and why are you yarning now ? are you bored ?
i did . but they said they won ’ t change them .
i really need a new pair of trousers .
yes , i do . this one is very old now .
they ’ re not all right . they ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible .
what happen , john ?
why do you look unhappy ?
why are you feeling depressed ?
i don ’ t think she will do such a thing .
oh , cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
what he said disappointed me .
he advised me to change to a more suitable course .
he said that career in law was unsuitable for a women .
mum , can i finish my homework later ?
but i want to watch tv now .
please .
not even for an hour ?
what's the matter ? you don't look well .
what about ?
oh , is that all ?
shall i get you another cup of coffee ?
shall i make more sandwiches ?
good morning , loans .
i would like to compliment you on your diligence .
yes . and we're proud of you , loans .
listen to this . mary got married .
yes . yesterday .
she married jerrod .
she ’ s going to live in paris .
my goodness ! you ’ re kidding !
that ’ s amazing ! you got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ?
come on ! don ’ t be silly !
i just had a terrible week .
i fell down and hurt my arm .
then my son drove into a tree .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
and a storm blew our roof away .
maybe we'd better go now .
gosh , it's already 10 . stay here if you like .
no , i shouldn't think so . by the way , is there a socket for my razor ?
is it a two pin socket ?
mr . ben , what do you think of the book ?
why ?
my friend jane is very beautiful .
perfect . and i like her charming eyes , too .
dark blue .
say , jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?
what do you mean ? it will help us to relax .
i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i don't feel like sitting at home .
that's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play pingpong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
what a terrible house !
the door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
don ’ t be worried . please sit down and take it easy .
but you should avoid finger pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts .
hi , cindy . i thought i ’ d missed you .
it ’ s all right .
mary seems depressed . what ’ s the matter ?
hi , becky , what's up ?
what's the problem ?
for example ?
no , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
we basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . she understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .
i thought we were supposed to meet here .
i ’ m sorry . we must have misunderstood each other .
you ’ re right . i am sorry . let ’ s go and watch the movie .
do you have to leave soon ?
oh , that ’ s better . so you don ’ t have to rush .
what ?
he knows you very well .
i ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . you ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . you must be very popular .
sally , i ’ m tired of this western food . i really miss my mother ’ s sichuan cooking .
i have tried . but americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .
i ’ m sick of my job , i always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office .
what do you suggest ? i can ’ t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
how beautiful the flower is !
you like it . well , i'll gather in for you .
they promised us a sea view .
so kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?
my uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . i was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .
i don't know . the ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good .
he did . it was one of the best ones available . but that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . and on a crowded street too .
you would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . no one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . the thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .
why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?
well , come and talk to me then .
may i turn on the radio then ?
ok , i will . but let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .
mark , you are not telling me the truth . now why ?
yes , all right . so why ? go on then . say it . oh , really , mark . i promise i'm not going to be angry . now why were you late ?
you forgot ? you .
ok . come back into the classroom , class .
yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
come on , baby . it ’ s time now .
er . alison ?
i just wanted to congratulate you ! i mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win .
it was that final sprint ! you were great ! really !
it's terrible how things have changed . you remember there used to be trees on all these hills .
no , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away .
would you like a cup of coffee ?
oh , no .
this machine is out of order .
i sure did .
mom , have we got any cookies ?
i know , but i'm hungry .
are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ?
i'm just asking . it's not like i'd actually make a bid .
don't worry . i won't .
on balance , dress designing appeals to me most .
say , how would you like to be a dress designer ?
who did the stupid thing ?
they were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and i ’ m left on my own to do the work . this is the first break i ’ ve had all day .
you won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the baker account ! me ! i ’ ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
they were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and i ’ m left on my own to do the work . this is the first break i ’ ve had all day .

just don't understand why we have to take the subway . look at this place . it's modern enough . but it's far from lively .
this isn't network , frida . we are in san francisco .
we haven't come here in business but for pleasure . we should go out exciting . what can you see in the subway ? nothing !
you miss the point ! we are not in a hurry to go anywhere .
i'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . can we leave this dull place now ?
i don't think the lecture is very interesting .
i feel he's like a talking machine .
how much is my stamp ?
don't get ahead of yourself . fat boy isn't yours yet .
you must have been prepared for a long time . some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?
now , the effort pays off . you have accomplished something .
your knowledge of english is really surprising .
no , seriously . i am impressed .
how smart of you to book the tickets before hand !
of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .
what a nice photo you ’ ve taken !
you have a real talent , ellen !
i ’ ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job !
i think you deserve a promotion .
is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
if there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
how's your new apartment ?
what's wrong ?
does it make a lot of noise ?
you're going to abandon me , just like that ?
when shooting a gun , accuracy is very important .
i think it's important that all people have the ability to read .
i have a complaint to make . the bill you sent me was incorrect . what's more , it isn't the first time
don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ?
one of my students told me she was very depressed today .
her father is dying .
yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid .
i talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . so , i made an appointment with the school counselor for her .
ugh . another advertisement . they ’ ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie .
why are we watching it anyway ?
sure .
did you hear what she said to me ?
what do you think i should do about it ?
how would you like your hair cut ?
i just got a telegram from margaret and greg .
i ’ m glad they ’ re coming in august . maybe greg and i can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game .
mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . mother ’ s very worried .
i don ’ t really like henry . i like my rose .
but my rose is great .
really , mary , you ’ re horrible .
bang ? ! bang ! bang ! what are the kings doing at seven o ’ clock on sunday morning ?
yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ?
and what ’ s mrs . king doing ?
what ’ s happening ?
what ’ s mr . king doing ?
and is she helping him ?
honey , why are you so angry ? can you tell me ?
why do you say such words ? i love you very much .
susan , just one last week i went out to have a lunch with her . there is nothing for you to be jealous about . i like your company much better than janet ’ s .
honey , you should know that i love you so deeply .
but honey , i think you ’ re terrific . there is nothing .
i ’ m tired , larry . can we have a break ?
i know , but i ’ m really tired . my stomach feels funny .
i was too excited to sleep last night . i didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late .
about 2 o ’ clock in the morning .
about 2 o ’ clock .
you did , but i can ’ t help it .
which one do i choose ? i don ’ t want to give up , but i really feel tired .
could you do me a favor ?
could you possibly give me a lift home ?
are you sure ? i don't want to inconvenience you .
look ! this picture of mom in her cap and gown .
yes , we are very proud of her .
surely , i'll have one made for you . you want a print ?
i'd like to see that myself .
she is so stupid .
so what ?
did you see that ?
how could you miss that ?
susan has been down recently . i saw her this morning , she looked terrible !
she broke up with her boyfriend .
she still loves him . that's why she feels upset . her love is always hard and confusing .
harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone .
what do you mean ?
yes , he's really pushed me too far .
i'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug .
but i ruined your rug .
too much , harry . don't blame her anymore .
i know . but there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ?
isn ’ t he the best instructor ? i think * he ’ s so hot . wow ! i really feel energized , don ’ t you ?
what ’ s wrong ? didn ’ t you think it was fun ? !
look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ?
are things still going badly with your house guest ?
thank you so much .
what ?
do you mind if i get a lift in your car , please ?
oh you ’ re so kind !
any chance of using your telephone ?
hey , leo . how come you look so terrible ? what ’ s going ’ on ?
how gross ! i can ’ t handle people like that . does he at least give you a hand around the house ?
man , what a freeloader . you better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . after all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here .
so , what happened ?
he stood you up .
not possible .
absolutely .
and no phone .
if ever you ’ re in chicago , please do look me up .
no trouble at all . i think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well .
how dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ?
i ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble .
i ’ m sorry , but i can ’ t find the book that you lend me .
i must apologize . i ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow .
i don ’ t think i can take another semester of this dorm food .
sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what i should do is move into an apartment off campus where i can cook for myself .
you know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ?
i got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem .
i ’ m afraid i spoke in all of the table clock .
i ’ m terribly sorry , won ’ t you let me pay for ?
would you mind doing something for me ?
would you please explain the meaning of the word ?
i would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days .
oh , this is the famous emperor palace building .
would you like to go to the top ?
excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers
until monday or tuesday next week .
adam . i ’ m sorry .
yes , but i couldn ’ t help it . i was late getting off work for a start and then i miss the bus . the bus i did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . it was one thing after another .
well , no . i thought i ‘ ve finish in five minutes . and i didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if i hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic i wouldn ’ t have been so late . i ’ m sorry .
this is a nice set of wheels . how much did the dealer charge you for this ?
okay then , let ’ s go fast ! whoa ! this thing can really accelerate fast .
hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . you know you tend to go fast ?
now watch . some guys probably run a light and hit your car .
you should have seen the line at the housing office . it took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . have you made yours yet ?
why not ? there ’ s not much time left . are you short of cash ?
you ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next september .
you should study in the library the way i do . think of the money you ’ d save .
so , this is the worst story i ’ ve heard this month . you have my real sympathy , tim .
i understand how you feel , but you ’ ve gotta learn to move on .
god , i didn ’ t realize . i didn ’ t , i didn ’ t know .
excuse me ?
you were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? you probably rented those children .
because i am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner .
what is that ? what are you doing ? you ’ re taking all the caviar ! that caviar is a garnish ?
you must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ?
but that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work .
hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing !
you did it yourself ? wow , you are good !
i just got laid off . the awful business , you know .
yeah , i ’ m better after talking to you .
how many orders do we still need to pack , gale ? we've been packing all day .
well . i am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . and it's about time to clock out .
why not ! these orders are not urgent . we could do it first thing tomorrow morning
you were doing great out there !
how's your new work , carl ?
good for you .
well , you have to take the bad with the good .
sorry , i overslept . my alarm clock didn't go off this morning .
that's right , even though i did set the alarm last night .
well . if it breaks down again tomorrow , i'll definitely buy a new one .
what do you mean too late ?
would you like to see our new shirts ?
well , they are very nice you know .
everybody is buying them .
yes , they are very fashionable , you see .
i see .
stop running around in front of the tv , will you ? why don ’ t you just sit and watch ?
then stay away . nobody's keeping you from doing that .
all right , i will explain it to you later on . now scram .
you spoken english is pretty good . please tell me your experience in learning english .
what's your method of learning ?
what if there is no chance ? i mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ?
i've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . i wonder how you managed to achieve such success ?
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ?
you mean you didn ’ t know much english then ?
that's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience .
how's your new car ?
you made a good choice , then ?
no regrets .
i am glad you are happy .
i wish i knew who had moved our flower pots .
what did you think you were doing ?
how dare you be so inconsiderate ? that's wrong .
never do that again .
why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?
well , come over and talk to me then .
may i turn on the tv then ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
i will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
flight be407 to rome is delayed . will passengers please wait in the lounge .
the time of departure will be announced as soon as possible .
hey , sorry to be late .
my mother was ill . i had to look after her .
excuse me , i wonder if you could help me ?
well , i hate to have to say this , but i'm not happy with my room .
well , the traffic is very loud . i got no sleep last night .
is anything the matter , sir ?
what's wrong with it , sir ?
i am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . i will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . how is your steak this time , sir ?
i am glad you enjoy it . i will tell this to the chef . would you like some more beer ?
how about some coffee or tea then ?
excuse me , i bought this sweater yesterday . but when i got home and tried it on , i found it ’ s too small .
yes , here you are .
oh , that's too bad .
hello , is this eye computers ?
well , easily , it doesn't work . it doesn't even start probably .
i must apologize for having delayed the work .
but you will miss your good chance . i ’ m so sorry
alright . we are out of everything .
we have absolute proof that you committed the crime .
can i help you ?
may i know the reason , madam ?
when did you buy it ?
can i see the receipt ?
i hate to see the abuse of animals .
i really dislike reading academic books .
would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ?
i really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive !
well . hum . you are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ?
well . since you ’ d like an honest answer , i will tell you the truth .
we ’ ve won two free tickets to hawaii for a seven day vacation !
eric , how long will you be in china ?
well , have you ever thought about learning some chinese ?
don't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy .
well , are you invested in some language exchange program ?
it's where i teach you chinese , and in exchange you teach me english .
how about this sunday ?
good . i'll give you a call tonight .
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
but you should tell me you were in love with her .
yes , but you might have told me before .
you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
why are you feeling depress ?
i don't think she would do such a thing .
oh , cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything .
then forgive her mistake .
the concert was really great .
the singing group used to be very popular .
thanks for lunch . it was delicious .
next time lunch is on me .
i'm serious .
good morning . phyllis seymour speaking .
hey ! that food was terrific . i can't eat another bite . are you sure you don't want another dish ?
i know what you mean . i'm so full that i can burst . shall we go then ?
i have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . i feel exhausted .
philip , i was really glad to hear about your award . congratulations !
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
have you followed the value of dollar lately ?
what we really should be making investment in is the euro . i've followed the euro's progress over the last quarter , i think it's about time to buy in .
this is today ’ s schedule . at eight thirty , conference with the department managers . at 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives .
3000 rib as bonus for each person .
ok . next thing is laying the corner stone for the new plant at 10 am . at 12 am , back here for lunch .
hi , lander . what's wrong ?
same here . i have't brought any new clothes for three months .
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
do you have s second ?
i want to tell you i've put in my notice .
i've been thinking about this for several months , well before the spring festival holidays .
yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , i want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . i've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and i still haven't received a pay rise . it's unfair .
well , then , may i invite you for the next dance ?
don't worry . i'm not much of a dancer myself .
in college . but i don't dance very often . what's your favourite dance ?
excuse me . in this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures .
we will keep and return it later .
i don't know how they do it ! our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . there is no way will be able to compete against that . we're barely breaking even with the present prices .
profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . how do they keep their price so low ?
yes , sir ?
hello , is this the abc company ?
we have just arrived from tokyo only . looking for a reserve car of your company . all of above , we cannot find it .
our reservation number is j 221 .
you mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ?
are you working overtime again ? over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! your company is draining the life out of you !
well , i hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work .
what ? ! isn't there a law against that , i think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . you should know your rights ! if you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation .
that's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ?
excuse me ! i don't have time to waste . i've been here almost one full hour !
unbelievable ! parking in this city is such a nightmare !
oh , gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i can't bear it anymore !
oh , my god !
that's the cutest little doll i've ever seen in my life !
what park ? you found a doll in a park ? gross !
what's that ?
for me ?
and lightweight , too . it'll play for 20 hours on two aa batteries !
and they're really safe . they'll protect your ear from sound damage .
i know . and you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music .
did your bid win ?
hey ! i'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! did you get the statue or not ?
maybe you'll get another chance at the statue .
and let them ruin my life ? forget it !
it's not worth it . besides , i have to save up to pay for some bills .
how do you get along with your co workers ?
do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ?
so how do you develop good relationships in the office ?
i always think everybody looks down on me
how can you be optimistic ? you can see it in their eyes .
don't be that negative .
i can't wait until my car is repaired . the commuting with public transportation is killing me .
but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning , i got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work .
that's true . the bus is even worse . just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! hey , how do you get to work every day ?
i'll bet it's good exercise , too . a good way to keep fit .
so you didn ’ t . is that right ?
why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? why would chinese answer questions this way ? i simply asked if you did it or not . it ’ s a very simple question . and chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer .
you know , today i asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . it ’ s a rule i made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . the funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer .
i ’ m sick of my job , i always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office .
what do you suggest ? i can ’ t afford to quit my job until i get a new one .
would you go to the bookstore with me ?
do you know jeffery has published his second detective novel ?
so what are you interested in ?
i know that magazine . it ’ s very popular .
i prefer potatoes to eggplants .
but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
hi , becky , what's up ?
what's the problem ?
for example ?
no , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .
and you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government .
i think you should look over these figures again . there are some calculations that are a bit off .
apology is accepted . try to do better next time .
she is really pretty , isn't she ? her skin looks so baby smooth !
ah , i can smell jealousy in the air .
yeah , yeah , yeah ! they wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . blah , blah . see , i can even recite it .
what ’ s the problem ? things are getting out of hand . you keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .
look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . every time i go through my book of business cards , i will notice it . it is an eye catching one .
yes , it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
you must like negotiating a lot . people are saying , you are a super negotiator .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
did you remember to bring back that software i lent to you ?
that ’ s ok . if you could just bring it in tomorrow , i would appreciate it .
you look really wiped out ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
did you punch in ?
where will you go in your vacation ?
henry , do you know how much we spent this month ?
how delicious ! tender and crisp !
yes , it's really savory .
this is the best dinner i've ever had .
i've never tasted anything better .
what a pin up she is !
what upsets you ?
it is not your mother finding one for you ?
no , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . i know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . you can be face to face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .
i think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so called love at first sight .
don ’ t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all , it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher .
let me clear away the broken glass .
it's very careless of me to have broken your glass .
she's pretty and meek .
what makes you think so ?
look out !
you must have rolled over something just now .
what a terrible house !
the door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart !
mrs . smith , time has stood still with you !
i'm not flattering you . you ' re full of energy every day .
i'm scared that she might not come back .
but she took her luggage away with her .
tell me , please .
i don't know what to do , if i can't find the money .
boy ! what a beauty ! i fall in love with her at the first sight .
of course . no girl is more charming .
i hear little bob has recovered .
the operation was very successful .
i feel pity for the old man .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
to be frank , i find philosophy rather boring .
i was scared stiff of giving my first performance .
crazy ! he locked himself in the room .
but you can see the key in his hand through the window !
do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ?
oh , but why ?
how do you feel about the tv series ?
yes , i agree , but still a lot of people watch it .
every teacher likes him .
how he manages to do that is always a mystery to me .
oh , please ! don't be so old fashioned ! it's totally safe .
all i did so far was make a bid on the buddha . it was easy !
how much did you bid ?
we'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! !
what if he had his friends fake the reviews ?
the tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural !
i am so glad i caught you at home . i need your help !
cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha . i can't keep them all straight !
but the auction is a blast ! and i haven't even told you the best part yet !
that stamp you've been looking for is for sale .
the great wall is a great attraction for visitors .
someone claimed it was one of the two man made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
i think this is the coolest watch i've ever owned .
isn't that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am .
is that hello kitty ?
is it real gold ?
let's skip the x files tonight , fran . okay ? just this once ?
how did you know ! there's a program on ancient egypt tonight .
look , it's starting !
wow ! that ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive .
it ’ s because of good quality and the fine design .
this shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand .
hi , mary ! you're here already . where's harry ?
that should give us time for a cup of coffee . i'll go and get some .
i'll never ever work together with him !
will you take my materials back from him for me ? please !
those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . they do everything together .
your daughter will be back soon . i'm going to start making dinner . you can just watch some tv in tv room if you like . we just bought a new tv with a lcd screen . the remote control is on the coffee ta
this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax .
ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . here's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ?
that's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ?
fine . i'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet .
i don't think it's broken .
isn't it wonderful walking here ?
i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us .
it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old fashioned ?
what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ?
what's there after that ?
what are all they for ?
what do you think about this store ? i heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .
don ’ t worry . i ’ ve decided that for your birthday i ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
how about this red dress ? i think it would really suit you .
here you go . on any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today .
let me look . let ’ s see . they ’ ve got one in blue , green , pink , black . and white . here you are .
i think you look fantastic . happy birthday !
mom , i just finished my paper . can you proofread it before i hand it in ?
thanks .
i really did ! i started thinking about what i wanted to say three weeks ago .
howdy ! nice car ! what seems to be the problem ?
not sure yet . how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good .
well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died .
i ’ m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks .
lady , you look unhappy . what ’ s the beef ?
you are late . what ’ s the deal ?
oh , no ! i ’ ve been assigned to work with jerry for our group project .
you have your ducks in a row .
you are an eager beaver .
mom . my legs are killing me .
hey , your chinese is coming along !
let ’ s cross here .
now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street .
driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind .
reciting texts really bores me to death .
what's all this noise about ?
why ?
do you like playing tennis ?
maybe you haven't found the magic .
i'm really sick of waiting for a bus .
but a taxi costs too much .
i'm tired of dancing .
maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners .
i find beijing opera is quite a bore .
what a boring film !
what a bother having to climb storeys home every day .
i must admit i'm not at all interested in math .
is there anything wrong with your food this evening , miss ?
sorry , miss . i'll place it immediately , can i get you another drink , or you wait ?
i'm sorry , miss , but i'm afraid we can't do that . you'll order something else instead . i'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty .
bother the flies !
i don't know . something rotten here ?
can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , i really like you . i'd like to take a relationship to the next level .
it feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . it seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .
i don't want to be like this . i think we should get step further .
like what ?
it was only the cheek .
oh , that is ridiculous .
definitely not .
how come ?
that guy's manner really turns me off .
all the routine work really browns me off .
she keeps spitting on the ground .
not bad , any other ideas ?
good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ?
they are good , but i still need a few more .
cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ?
do you like our new history teacher ?
you can't say that ! he's a very knowledgeable person .
my uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . look !
i just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . he is super cool .
well , your time has been well spent !
then tell me what's good about it .
i hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight . seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox .
i ’ m miss sherman . what seems to be the problem ?
the advertised rate is based on double occupancy .
are you quite sure ?
i see . i had no idea our advertising was so misleading . it is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page .
normally i couldn ’ t do that . but under the circumstances , i ’ ll see what i can arrange . customer satisfaction is our primary aim .
your search on this project has been excellent .
the final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . i think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client .
we are planning to go to beidaihe for vacation . do you want to go with us ?
you look great today . and so beautiful . i love your elegant haircut .
could you do me a favour ? i don ’ t understand this french document .
i have been working 70 hours this week . i am totally maxed out .
so , emily , how was your day ?
it can't have been that bad . go on and tell me about it .
that's not very fair . what did you do ?
does he treat everyone in your department like this ?
do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ?
that's very sensible . it sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders .
i don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me !
i tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that i didin't want to ever talk to them again !
they both just talk about how great they are all the time .
they are ! besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . they're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .
most of my other neighbours are scared of them .
i can't afford to move right now .
i think you're being a bit optimistic . if you met them , you'd understand .
are you alright , ethan ? you don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are .
what happened ?
what did your boss say ?
that's horrible . was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?
is your boss chinese ?
what are you going to do ?
that sounds like a sensible plan . do you want me to help you with your job search ?
today is your birthday . first of all , happy birthday to you !
i got a promotion . lunch is on me .
this is just for you . cheers ! bottoms up .
i am told that you dance like an animal . why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ?
way to go ! it seems beautiful and very delicious .
i can ’ t bear it . the driver is too bad .
i find that every employee here respects that manager very much .
hi , why do you look so depressed today , mike ?
how come ?
i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ?
look ! that man who is baking bread is so handsome .
jane , what do think about this dinner ?
how do you like the pizza here ?
hurry up . time is running out .
oh , my god ! my wallet is lost . what should i do ? it drives me bonkers .
mom , look , that cake looks delicious . my mouth is watering .
i ran into a glass door yesterday .
what a nice uniform !
not really . i was being sarcastic . does it come with the job ?
they're not actually that bad . they could be worse . what do you think about it ?
so are you enjoying your new job ?
how do you like working in sales ?
i know ! she could sell fridges to eskimos !
i don't know . i didn't think it was that interesting .
wow ! it ’ s packed .
hey , cindy , i ’ m so sorry about yesterday . i shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone .
i don ’ t know what happened to me . i just lost it .
you're rather energetic today . what's going on ?
free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ?
my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . i can't wait for the weekend !
you can say that again ! he won't even let us check our personal email at work !
really ? i didn't know that it was against company policy .
no , he is . some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . he always follows the rules to a t .
thanks . i better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again !
is everything alright ?
what took so long ? i thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago !
i didn't hear anything about a delay . i thought everything was running on time . what happened ?
then what ? your plane was three hours late !
turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ?
so where did you land ?
have you had anything to eat ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ?
what's wrong with it ?
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
what else is wrong with it ?
anything else ?
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
it wasn't just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
we're already late , so i think we had better take a taxi .
fine . have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
don't worry . nothing bad will happen . i'll even buy your ticket for you .
i love her so much , you know . i want to be alone . please keep quiet .
you can take this car into consideration . it works well and its price is reasonable .
did you get my email ?
sure .
well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
i also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . i spent half of the weekend on a train ! surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
i see . well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . it was really tiring for me .
thank you . i can't imagine getting much done today . i'm just too exhausted !
are you ready to go the concert ?
actually , why don't we go there by bike ? we could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour .
is your helmet comfortable ?
maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
is that your new bicycle ?
it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . these are really expensive !
that's easy . it's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
yesterday i had a deal with a vice manager . he acts like the point man .
you are very late , but i was on pins and needles the whole time .
did you get any pizza ? when i got there , only small one was left . what a pity !
i am so sorry that i must be off now . my girlfriend told me i must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me .
you are freaking me out .
it smells like an ashtray in here !
what ’ s wrong ? i thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .
look , there are other ways to quit . you can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . we spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . it ’ s not like you can just light up like before .
did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? you have such a big mouth !
ok . i ’ ll talk to you later . bye
yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . i try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .
i guess you are right . what do you think i should do ? he wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know .
hi , i made a reservation for a mid size vehicle . the name is jimmy fox .
i don ’ t understand , i made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
but the reservation keeps the car here . that ’ s why you have the reservation .
i don ’ t think you do . if you did , i ’ d have a car . see , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . anybody can just take them .
fine . i ’ ll take the compact .
look at what you have done . all thumbs .
oh , my god ! i've been cheated !
it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it !
there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick .
so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four hundred dollar camera for twenty bucks .
yes .
yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .
he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .
c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect looking box .
. now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , ed ! give us some good news . how are things looking for us in terms sales this month ?
what ? ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news !
for crying out loud . how fast are we losing money ?
what ! geez ! how could this have happened ? so what ’ s the bad news ?
are you joking ? get the supplier on the line now ! they have to assume the costs of this mess !
we ’ re doomed !
really ? what !
valerie ! hi ! wow how have you been ? it ’ s been such a long time !
really ? thanks ! i went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! look at you ! you haven ’ t aged a day since the last time i saw you ! what is your secret !
yes , my little paul is finally a doctor . they grow up so fast you know .
thank you ! what about your daughter , pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
such a lovely girl . i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
same here ! we will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
what ' the matter ?
i see . you simply can't blame the server for this .
that's true .
well , i personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy .
yes . i am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ?
well , actually two thirds of americans may avoid these places .
the sun is up ! time for all the campers to rise . time to get paddling .
do not worry . today will be easier .
today is july 4th .
call her on my cell phone . wish her “ happy birthday ! ” tell her you are out exploring the great american wilderness . tell her i said she is lucky to be born on independence day .
it is december 25th .
yes , i am lucky . i was born on christ ’ s birthday . maybe that is why i usually go to church on sundays . when is your birthday ?
that is true ! here , have some granola for breakfast .
after eating , we will take down our tent . then we will pack everything into the canoe , we can shove off by 6
how about going for swim around 10
it's getting cold .
oh , it's made of wool . i like the striped pattern .
that's a good idea . when did you buy it ? is it a name brand ?
that looks lovely . just one more thing you need a pair of earrings .
perfect !
thanks . we should be ourselves . there are so many fashion victims out there .
same here . i have't brought any new clothes for three months .
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
inflation is more than just the rising prices , i guess . but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
you said it . i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
your garden is looking beautiful this summer . the flowers are really colorful .
yes , i do . those are violets , aren ’ t they ?
the lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . would you like me to cut them off for you ?
when the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree .
veronica ! veronica ! veronica ! are you ok ?
i will come clean as soon as we get to safety , ok ? for now , you have to trust me , please ! i would never do anything to hurt you .
i haven ’ t been completely honest with you veronica , i ’ m sorry . i ’ m not a fireman . i ’ m not even from the united states . i ’ m a spy for the indian government .
when i was a young boy , i used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of hyderabad . it was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . one day , he was approached by members of the cia , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio chemistry . i never saw him again . i vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the indian intelligence bureau .
i ’ m sorry , i wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . i wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when i tell you that what i feel for you is real .
stephanie ! did you just get to school ? but you were up and about when i left the dorm this morning ! that was about an hour and a half ago . this happens all the time ! why do you always take so long
please explain because it makes no sense to me . how can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? you get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . half an hour , tops .
true , i hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ?
i'm not satisfied with it .
sometimes it goes fast . and sometimes it goes slow . and the alarm doesn'twork , either .
a receipt ?
you mustn't touch the wet paint , bill .
try to be more careful in future .
the workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice .
then why isn't there a notice ?
mom , why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks .
but i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl .
but i do not like anyone touch my head .
what if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ?
does this mean that if i might want those new european bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ?
so , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . well done !
what are you thinking of doing ?
there must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . you could do some research for a university . there ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . someone wit
next please ! hello sir , may i see your passport please ?
will you be checking any bags today .
i ’ m sorry , sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry on luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .
i am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either . carry on bags must fit in the over head compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big .
let ’ s see . six hundred and twenty five us dollars .
car trouble center . how may i help you ?
hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems .
ok , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ?
those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ?
no . if you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start .
i know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ?
hi isabel ! you wanted to see me ?
okay .
what ? why ? i mean . just like that ? i ’ m fired ?
what ! i resent that !
oh , my god ! i've been cheated !
there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick .
so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four hundred dollar camera for twenty bucks .
yes .
i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .
c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect looking box .
i think someone is stalking me .
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too .
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
he followed me all the way home !
yes , he was . i'm not imagining it . finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he didn't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i'm so scared . can i call the police ?
i suppose . what can they do ? i don't even know who he is .
i ’ ve had it ! i ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
well , no . it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
well , that seems easy enough .
hello there ! come on in ! don ’ t just stand there ! come and take a seat !
oh my gosh ! your hair is amazing ! so silky , so shiny ! i am going to work my magic on your hair ! you hear me ? you are going to look like a million bucks !
don ’ t you worry , i ’ ll take care of everything ! oh my god ! i just love your curly hair ! it ’ s so fluffy and cute ! you should totally let it grow out . an afro would look great on you !
what do you think of this one ?
and this one ? too flashy ?
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn ’ t it hideous ?
are you even listening ? i ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
oh , your precious game . you watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
hey , mary , can you cut that out ?
the tapping of your pen on your desk . it ’ s driving me crazy .
i don ’ t slurp my coffee . and plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ?
look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up i ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are .
the mosquitos are biting me !
do you have any bug spray ?
then we ’ ll have to put up with it .
what are you doing ?
come on ! stop being so vain . you look great ! you are beautiful !
i don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! you are stop beings ridiculous . besides , i think that people who get boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . it doesn ’ t look natural .
i think you need to get brain surgery . i honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . you look amazing .
you don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . you are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! plus , plastic surgery hurts !
honey come on ! we are going to be late ! honestly , you take longer getting ready than i do !
what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ?
are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
wow , that terrible movie is finally over . next time i ’ m picking the film , because i don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick .
not everything , just this film . even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that i ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i ’ m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
love stories ? more like one night stands .
my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ?
honey , i ’ ll be right back !
i told you already ! i ’ m going to get my nails done .
they don ’ t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
hi dude , you look upset , what's up ?
what's the problem ?
well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down .
i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand , when i wanted some quiet time , and people kept
hey , ann , i am really sorry about last night . i shouldn't have said those things to you .
don't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime .
well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ?
nah , i wouldn't worry about that . but i don't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves .
hi mary , how's it going ?
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
really ? what happened ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well , in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
the dinner was really good . it knocked my socks off .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
the port is exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ?
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
it's made from naturally frozen grapes .
oh , here's to your health .
we are going out for dinner tonight . are you coming , betty ?
oh , jake made a reservation at friday's .
yes , the one with the r $ d team . is that a problem ?
why did you say so ?
oh , really ?
are you kidding me ? how could he behave like that ?
what a shame ! didn't he realized that ?
maybe he should really something about eating etiquette .
i can ’ t believe it !
yes , but i bet $ 200 dollars on the cougars !
i can ’ t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
doris , i'm glad you're home . i'm terrified . i don't know what to do !
i think someone is stalking me .
i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring . he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop .
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too .
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
yes , he was . i'm not imagining it . finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him . he was just standing there . he didn't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious . what should i do ? i'm so scared . can i call the police ?
why can't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me !
i suppose . what can they do ? i don't even know who he is .
hi , bob , everything okay ?
oh ? what's that ?
what gift ?
you refused the gift ? that's terrible .
are you cold ?
i wonder if we can change the temperature .
well , they have it too cold in here . i want to be warmer . i won't be able to sleep .
what did they say about the air conditioning ?
that's stupid . how can i sleep in this ?
i tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak english well enough . so i decided to go to the magazine shop . the one around the corner . and i bought an american newspaper .
it seems that yesterday the mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the world bank . the government declared a default on the loans .
i know . the economy here is having serious problems . but because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down .
yes , it's an amazing drop .
yes , it's very good . we suddenly have twice as much money to spend here . our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! isn't that strange ?
what ?
i'm tired of you always wearing my clothing !
it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it !
there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick .
so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four hundred dollar camera for twenty bucks .
yes .
i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .
c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect looking box .
i've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team !
what's wrong with him ?
my brother started investing money when he was 16 years old .
i'd like to talk with you again about what happened .
i'm so busy . i don't know how will get this done .
this cake is excellent . where did you buy it ?
she is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing .
so , you ’ re applying for a b2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the united states ?
and , who is sponsoring your trip ?
alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
you are not being a good sport about this .
i never cheat .
he came to work late every day that week . then on friday , he didn't show up at all .
hurry up , get in .
ok , make a left here . . . no wait , i meant make a right . come on , speed up !
don ’ t worry about it , just drive . oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it !
whatever . just turn right here . . . . the freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street . go on ! get out of our way ! move , move !
here , i know a short cut . just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though ashburn heights . let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! watch out for that lady !
yes ! we made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes .
fine , thank you .
yeah . it ’ s pretty cold , alright .
no , i don ’ t like football .
she ’ s my wife ! oh , here ’ s my floor ! nice talking to you . goodbye .
this is such a beautiful day ! great for sailing !
why are you doggy paddling ? i taught you how to swim ! do your breast stroke !
try kicking your legs more . that ’ s good . don ’ t go out too far !
kathy ! get back here ! i see a shark !
i had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else .
just a few christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all !
umm . no . i make these in my workshop in the north pole !
i wish i could unsay the sharp words to him . he must hate me very much .
ok , mr . wu . you may come in . i'm anne smith and on my right , my colleague , anna duncan , and on my left , angela lamb . do please sit down .
your english is fluent .
how do you think of the weather today ?
i'm sorry , sir . but this is the self service pump .
in america , most gas stations are like this .
well , since this is your first time , i will do it for you . but next time , if you want a full service gas station , you should look at the sign .
hurry up . we're going to be late .
what are you doing ?
oh , no ! now i'll be late .
yes , i'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown .
do you have the five dollars i lent you yesterday ?
you don't have to go right away .
i know you're sleepy and i hate to bother you , but i think you're late for work .
don't worry . i can give you a lift .
excuse me . i'm afraid you're in my seat . you've moved my books .
what brought this on ?
wow ! that's a fantastic movie !
who was the director ?
nothing really .
bob , what are you thinking about ?

i'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here .

i'm going to japan this year on vacation .
no , but i'd really like to .
i've moved .
hello , mary .

don't be afraid . give it a try .
i'm not a vip .
paul sends you his regards .
thanks for your help .
let me know if i can do anything for you .
i was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains .
i was thinking it could take place sometime in january .
yes , you are right .
yes , that would work out better .
good idea ! we'll have to get right on it .
could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ?
it is in the hotel ballroom down the street .
we will need it for both days .
the van will be driven by mary and me .
oh yeah , no problem . would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom .
the mountains would be a great place for the company retreat .
i have chosen january as the month for this retreat .
yes , maybe another choice might be better .
thank you for thinking of that .
i am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday .
it may not be the best choice for me , but i am considering it .
i believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me .
also , the matter of pay is also a consideration .
yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice .
it's all over . i'm bankrupt .
i think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year .
january would be a good month for a mountain retreat .
you know , now that i think about it , you might be right .
that is a good suggestion .
i was wondering if i could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend .
it is in the park downtown .
we will need it for saturday only .
yes , we can do that . can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ?
our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible .
it will be at the beach by the pier .
we will only be needing it for sunday .
the only two drivers will be mary and i .
sure . we also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . would that be ok ?
i needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .
are you sure you're finished ?
you did a horrible job on my hair .
i don't like anything about it .
that's fine , but i'm not paying for it .
what's new ?
what's taking you so long ?
i need you to hurry up .
i think there's more you need to do .
my hair looks awful .
i just don't like my hair .
i won't be paying you for this .
there is that .
well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
this is great , isn't it ?
we should do this more often .
great . what do you think of it ?
did you go to the summer mountain resort ?
it sounds great , and is it really cool there ?
what is the special local product ?
what was that all about ?
is she going to be okay ?
what day is it ?
i'm leaving on november 10th .
no , it's a monday .
does that help you faith ?
excuse me . do you have the time ?
is it ? oh , no . the concert will begin in twenty minutes . are we too late to get there ?
i need help preparing for my presentation on friday .
are you sure you have the time ?
what would be the best time for you to help me ?
should we just meet here ?
i'll see you then .
whoa , look at all those ice cream choices !
i love anything with chocolate the best .
is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ?
i haven't ever cared for that myself .
hi , why do you look so depressed today , mike ?
how come ?
could you help me prepare for my presentation on friday ?
i hate to ask you to do something like that .
would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ?
i'll come prepared .
there are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from !
i love fruit flavored ices the best .
what is your least favorite ice cream ?
yeah , i know what you mean .
that could be interesting .
i was thinking about applying for the new position .
it seems like a good idea but i am not really sure .
well , it would give me a chance to grow , but i am wondering if i would like the job .
i am also thinking about the pay .
is my hair done yet ?
how long until you're finished ?
i like my hair so much .
it's beautiful .
how much is it for my hair ?
thanks for everything .
i have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !
vanilla with toppings is my favorite .
no way ! do you have a flavors you don't like ?
i think that would be horrible !
i want to try something different today .
i want a different hair style .
can you make my hair short ?
i've been thinking about this for a while now .
i honestly want my hair that short .
are you almost finished with my hair ?
how much longer is it going to be ?
i absolutely love it .
yes , i truly do .
how much do i owe you ?
here you go , thanks for everything .
let's do something different today .
i would like you to give me a different hair style .
give me a short haircut .
i want you to cut it to a few inches long .
i've had this idea for some time now .
this is what i want .
will you be done doing my hair soon ?
how much time do you need ?
i think it looks gorgeous .
i honestly think it looks great .
how much is it for my hair ?
thanks for doing such a good job .
i really want to switch things up .
i think i want to try a new style .
i want you to cut my hair shorter .
yes , i've been wanting it short for a while now .
i'm absolutely sure that this is what i want .
please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
this dish taste terrific . would you like to try a little ? it is a little hot , but very good .
would you like another beer ?
come on , it's the weekend . let's taste and enjoy this meal . cheers !

i ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet .
thank you .
are you satisfied with the dishes ?
i like it , too . i like the fish especially . it's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish .
great , i love hot food too .
hey , karen . look like you got some sun this weekend .
that ’ s great . where did you stay ?
so , what did you do out there ? i mean besides bask in the sun , obviously .
not to mention cooler . did you go swimming ?
it all sounds so relaxing . i wish i could get away to the beach like that .
what ?
nothing .
yes , i am .
i don ’ t actually know him .
i only know him through the . you are not gonna believe this .
yes .
do bullfights interest you much ?
you ’ re a wonderful person , kathleen .
and i ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy .
you don ’ t love me ?
but we ’ re so right for each other .
well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . what about you ?
i heard that kevin got divorced . is that true ?
what ?
poor kevin , we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well .
actually i have a passion for chinese literature .
yeah , those classics from the great writers .
so what kind of music turns you on ?
you mean the kind of stuff like nirvana ?

susan ? what brings you here today ?
really ? so what ’ s the news ?
i'm feeling down .
where's bob ?
can you give him a call on his mobile ?
what day is it today ?
i've just had an argument with bob .
he did and it's his entire fault .
what are you doing this weekend ?
you said you like classical music very much . then who is your favorite opera star ?
oh , you mean pavarotti , domingo and carreras . have you been to their live shows ?
i've heard of that one . it was also his swan song .
of course not . people all over the world watch it on tv , or listen to it on the radio .
yes , i went to the new year's concert in 2005 .
that's for sure . you know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . i had the greatest time ever .
lorin maazel . he did an amazing job . moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday .
the right opportunity for you would come along soon . you know , music is transnational .
are you free tonight ?
did you hear about bob and mary ?
they had an argument and split up .
it's getting late .
do you like flowers ?
peach blossom is really beautiful .
i like lotus .
but there aren't any lotus now .
did you watch the movie program on channel 6 last night ?
i wonder why tv programs often show much violence .
they are especially harmful to teenagers .
dad , what's the date ?
in seven days it will be christmas day .
you've met her before , haven't you ?
he's too young for the job .

i will never forget this match . the angle is so terrible and so correct .

the music has started .
it's very nice .
certainly .
dad , i'm scared .
but , dad , it's stormy outside .
the breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake .
do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ?
thanks for everything .
how was your date recently ?
yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars .
forget about it !
how was your first date , david ? are you satisfied with jane ?
yes , so i think she is suitable for you .
stop acting like this . say away !
what did she say ?
how's business ?
how about going to dance this evening , jane ? you will find that the night life of this city is very interesting !
yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music .
that's rock and roll with fast tempo .
take it easy . the time for slow dance is the middle part of the party .
ok , follow me .
may i ?
are you free tonight ?
what's your favourite steps ?
how about rumba ?
really ? you must like tango , right ?
don't be so modest . i'm sure you can dance it very well . let's dance it now .
oh , you dance it so well .
how do you like waltz ?
in fact , i took up dancing quite recently , too .
i'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . it's lucky that i got a partner .

what the hell are you doing now ?
what's new with you ?
of course , he was our monitor in college . how is him now ?
a dozen .
it's surely worth going to . there are ten famous spots there .
let's go for a drink after work .
fred , can you tell me how i can open my qq zone ?
well , i have to provide some of my information , right ?
all information is filled in and now i can design my zone .
now everything is ok . i can write my blog , right ?
( half an hour , janice begins shouting excitedly . ) what's the matter with you ?

i'll help you with your homework .
i saw your car outside , so i stooped by .
are you going to take the job ?
thanks for the loan .
b , what's in your hand ?
why do you read them ?

shall we have a drink someday ?
excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ?
that's great !
where are you going this weekend ?
so boring ! shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ?
fred and david , my college class mates and rachel .
your tent and enough food and water .
we can go fishing , chatting and camping .
tom's dating your sister .
hello , jane . what do you do in your spare time ?
don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ?
i like collecting antiques . it's expensive , but it's a lot of fun .
so far i have more than 500 collections .
hey ! fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . usually , you don't .
what's your meaning ?
you are a thief ?
can you give me a ride back home ?
it is a great place for a relaxing vacation .
yeah , i agree . it makes you feel really good .
do you like climbing ?
how about climbing up the fragrant mountain tomorrow ?
it is located at the east foot of western mountain of beijing , in a park with the same name . there are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' fragrant mountain ' .
many times . except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting .
it is the best season to view red leaves from the mid october to the first ten days of november . during the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . the bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between .
you can take a bird eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain .
david , imagine meeting you here !
all right ! i stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . i stole your peaches and flowers .
how many vegetables do you steal today ?
so funny . by stealing , i forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work .
i really want to be far away from the reality now .
awful ! my cell phone is out of service again . fred , can you lend me some money ?
200yuan . i bought a computer online , so i have to pay the mortgage .
it's so nice of you . you really make my day .
what you said is absolutely right . i will pay you back as soon as i get back on my feet .
we'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ?
rob lost his bike .
do you surf online regularly , joe ?
are you crazy ? what are you doing four hours online ?
online chat ? aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ?
hello , kate .
i was almost on line the whole night .
no , i listened to the music , too .
thanks a million .
jim was late again .
hello , catherine . would you like to go out tomorrow ?
yeah , i was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie .
yes . we can do something else if you like .
well . what time would you like me to pick you up ?
good . i will see you then .
jenny , do you want to go to see a movie ?
i want to see ' click . '
how's john doing ?
why are you shivering ?
i wouldn't dare go bungee jumping .
i want to take care of you forever . will you marry me ?
am i too abrupt ? did i scare you ? or you don't want .
oh , i'm so happy . i will try my best to love you and protect you . i promise .
let me wear you this diamond ring .
honey , i've got good news for you .
you are going to be a father .
what are you guys doing ?
honey , what's wrong with you ?
take it easy . we are going to have our own baby . you should be happy .
the doctors and the nurses will help you . and i will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
wait for me 。
how's work ?
could you please wait for a minute ? i'll buy the tickets
here is your ticket .
the park will close soon . we should better go in right now .
yes , let's go in .
yes , how do you know ?
well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
sorry . i've got to run .
have you ever been there ?
what is especially impressive ?
is there a waterfall ?
what an attractive place ! how can i get there ?
how did you do that ?
see you later , alligator .
i'm back .
going shopping . it tires me too much .
can i ?
ok . what does it sell ?
where are you going ?
why not listen to music online ?
you can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
in order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
certainly . realplayer is a good .
yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
do you have any particular hobbies , tom ?
i hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . and they don't care about their own health at all . how about you ?
it's no good . and i think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . you might as well do something healthy and meaningful .
come on in . make yourself at home .
do you have a minute ?
bye . take care .
we'd better leave now .
i just got sacked .
happy birthday ! many happy returns ( of the day ) .
i'm sorry , but i can't come to your party .
what do you do ?
what a coincidence seeing you here . !
how do you like my new sports car ?
what part of the visit excited you most ?
why ?
yes , i think so . but there is also something terrible .
sometimes the traffic is too busy .
let's take a coffee break .

no problem . i'm an ' olympic expert ' .
they name it after the place where it was first held .
this question is a piece of cake . a frenchman named baron de coubertin .
of course he was called ' the father of the olympics ' .
he once made a speech on the ‘ renaissance of the olympics ' .
hi ! bob , are you having problems with that ?
it's easy , let me help you .

you are right . what about shoes ?
thanks a lot .
i broke my sister's mirror . i'm sure it'll get her back up . i really don't know how i can escape the punishment .
do you like watching the winter olympic games ?

the performance is amazing . i'm curious about how they did it . i mean the way they sing .
so cool . someone gave me this flier at the exit . what's it about ?
oh , tell me about it . anything interesting ?
' the drunken beauty ' ? it's funny that we have ' sleeping beauty ' in my country . anyway , what's it about ? is the beauty a drunkard ?
sure , people do that when they are drunk . what about the actress ?
oh , i've heard about him before . he even created a special dance of sleeve shaking .
you know , interest is the best teacher .
please do that . i can't wait to come back again . the performance must be really amazing .
what are you doing ?
we came too early . there're still three hours before the performance starts .
never mind . what about taking a look around the theater ?
here we go . there is a museum of the beijing opera art . ( they come to the museum of the beijing opera art . )
not really . they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?
no , no , no . they are all handmade , girl . you know , the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
very few can . that's why these clothes only appear in the museum .
oh , yes . i heard there was an opera fans club . they are probably practicing now . wanna have a look ?
follow me . make sure not to interrupt them .
i've heard that tom is going to move .
why did you say that ? it's a good thing for him to live with his son .
there is a wonderful opera today . i'd like to see it .
' the sound of music ' . this music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . it is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language .
yes , you are right . i like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ?
no , i am asking you whether you will go to see it .
what happened to that girl you were seeing ?
that was a short relationship . you only started dating 2 months ago .
what do you mean ?
she sounds very emotional .
were you suppose to be there ?
ok . you're right . she's a psycho .
how was the party last night ? did you enjoy it ?
why ? what happened ?
what about the party ?
so how long did you stay ?
do you like plum blossoms ?
it's snowing heavily . what about taking a walk ?
what a heavy snow !
i've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much .
do you smell the sweet scent ?
what part did you get in the play this time ?
i wish i had a character part . those are my favorite .
i know , but i've done that so ay times . it's getting old . the leading guy is always the same macho a .
next time . you are going to love your part . i've seen the script .
professor wang looks so handsome today . he is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie .
he ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . he gets different tie each day .
the tie is necessary for man . it makes you look so attractive in a super tie .
my father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat .
what is that you have there ?
ah ha ! i caught you . just let me peek . i won't tell anyone .
how about one little hint ?
that's a very good hint .
do you have a family tradition at christmas time ?
what is it ?
that's it ? that's the tradition ?
i guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun .
look , here're two coins named kai yuan tong bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . these two coins were made in different periods of the tang dynasty .
the one made in the early tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late tang period . look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now .
various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . we usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . we can judge it with naked eyes .
certainly , they did . liao coins and song coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the southern song and yuan period some 800 1000 years ago . the liao coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the mongolian tribe . let me look for one and show you .
hey jackie . what are you doing ?

mark , you've been coming home late these days . what are you busy doing ?

when crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you .
i am not sure . we will ask for directions in the coffee shop .
when did you decide to become a vegetarian ?
that's great . do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ?
you've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ?
how do you get enough protein in your diet ?
well , don't worry about dinner . i'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . do you like sushi ?

you'll never guess what i won at work today ! tickets to tonight's final nba game .
of course ! and here's the best part , they are court side seats !
some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
the game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
i've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . i wonder how you managed to achieve such success ?
i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ?
you mean you didn't know much english then ?
that's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ?
what are you reading ? you've had your nose buried in that book since last night .
can i read it when you're finished ?
don't tell me anything about it . i want to read it for myself .
it seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic .
i'll participate in a quiz about the 29th olympic games in beijing . it will be held tonight . will you come ?
it was held in 776 b . c . at olympia . it also has a long history of more than 2700 years .
yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of world war i and world war ii .
oh , it's the beijing 2008 olympics ' emblem . it's a chinese seal , meaning that chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world .
my husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . i'm fed up with it .
how do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ?
he's 78 and he's a new emigrant from south america and he's never been to school .
no . but i thought that you could start with reading and then go from there .
come on . you're great at teaching and i know you will love him . he's adorable !
how annoying !
every time i try to start this program , the computer freezes .
as we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .
is it ? i've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
that's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
i'm too tired now . i've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and i have to do the work alone . this is the first break i've had all day .
i'm afraid i can't before i finish this project .
i will , thanks for your concern .
well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ?
but what about the indirect ones ?
i see . for the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
i'm tired .
you wouldn't believe what happened to me today .
i have to go home now , jenny . thanks for inviting me to your party .
bob , you look pale . what happened ?
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you .

this will be the best ski trip i've ever taken . i can't wait to use my new hoard .
david , i heard you lost your job .
hello , i'm jack . are you christina ?
are you from italy , christina ?
i am from california in the united states . but i am now studying in england .

i might just do that . what style of clothes do they have ?
i was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection .

susan , i haven't seen you in the pub for a long time .
what's wrong with debbie today ? she seems upset about something .
linda ? is that you ? i haven't seen you in ages !

i love your bracelet . when did you get it ?
yeah . it's beautiful . is it white gold or silver ?
where did you buy it ?
that's so sweet . what was the occasion ?
you're so lucky . if he bought you something for no special day , i wonder what he would buy you for your birthday .
what do you want ?
why not a ring ?
but you're ready for everything else ?
do you have any year end benefits ?
i just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year end benefits .
they got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card .
it is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves .
i think i'll write a book .
all of the time tested healthy habits from around the world .
the interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype .
that's right . i think we all have much we can learn from each other .
for the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
i hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
perfect . it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
yes . and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
what a beautiful watch . it goes very well with your ring .
is that your wedding ring ?
well , congratulations . when is the big date ?
you did a fabulous job with the selection . it's gorgeous .
what kind of watch is it ?
if you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
that's why it looks so nice . i should have figured . you always get what you pay for .
there is a new coffee shop opening up down the street .
that's right . you don't drink coffee , do you ?
what kind of things would you like to see on the menu ?
that shouldn't be too difficult . since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion .
let's do both ! are we in a rush or anything
sounds fine to me . whatever , let's enjoy this pond first .
i see them ! wow ! how do you know they're wild ?
it's really late but i'm starving .
maybe they have some good pie .
there was a coffee shop by my house when i was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate .
good stuff . oh , no . the door is locked .
thanks . i'm so excited . we've been trying for 8 months now .
three months .
i know i am going to be busy , but i know i can handle it . i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ?
thanks so much .
i had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries .
it says that traditionally , give something made of paper .
the boss is planning to sell the company .

you didn't show up to my performance last night ! some kind of friend you are !
sure . you look like you're all black and blue .
you're serious ?
i guess i misjudged you . i hope you can forgive me .
hey , sandy . do you want to go to the etv with us ?
who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ?
he's the us president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ?
that's right . he ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .
he had great vision , didn't he ?
hey , let's arm wrestle !
chicken ! you're afraid i'll beat you .
hey jack . what's going on ?
that's exciting , man .
you shouldn't use my example . it wasn't special . i kind of wish i made it more special but it's too late now .
there are a lot of options . you can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her .
thought about what ?
i don't know . you should know how she's going to react . she is your girlfriend .
i've been chosen to plan the next family reunion .
yep . and i should start planning now .
just about . there are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone .
usually it's at least five days and four nights .
can you vouch for me that i was with you yesterday ?
my character is in question . someone was robbed at work and unless i have an alibi , i'm a suspect .
my employer . can you come in to the office tomorrow ?
that would be the real proof . didn't we have to show id to get on the plane ?
jack , could you check your calendar ?
we're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone .
you really look familiar .

nice pun . what is it you active about him most ?
he looks like a very personable man .
what sport do you like the most ?
me too . did you play when you were a kid ?
what position did you play ?
i hate third base . it's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast .
i played outfield . i hated the infield because i never figured out all the bounces .
i'm on a softball league . it's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . you wanna join our group ?
we play either tuesdays or thursdays .
what sports do you like to play ?
how about football ?
for me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play .
no , i just for fun with my friends . we play two hand touch or flag football . we're too old to play tackle football .
instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing .
exactly . we play every saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . if you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us .
ok . i'll call you saturday morning .
hey steve . when's the next time you're going to play golf ?

twilight rates are 21 dollars .
aright . i'll get a tee time for wednesday at about 4
ok . i'll call you later when i get a tee time .
aright . have fun on saturday .
can i borrow your cds for our school dance ?
i promise i will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition .
that sounds fair . that's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us .
our class doesn't have enough money . we already checked into it .
are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ?
i know what you mean .
or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them .

very beautiful and very interesting . but why do you hang them in the tree ?
hello , this is david .
is it the plans for my new house ?
what stresses you out the most ?

you have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents .
ever since i brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much .
what do you do to deal with the stress ?
that sucks . you wanna go grab a beer ?
it's going to strike 12 o'clock . let's get the firecrackers ready , rose .
well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . it's ok here . it would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . the habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .
do you bring some gifts along ?
is it the same practice for all families ?
i really appreciate the way you chinese people exchange feelings . the holiday's long enough for you to relax .
jared , i just heard about your father . how is he doing ?
i'm so sorry to hear that . but this is a good hospital . i'm sure they will do whatever they can .

bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time the 2005 international tourism festival is around the corner .
my pleasure . well , the festival is going to start on the third saturday of october , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month .
i don't know what to suggest . there're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . one exciting program might be the ten thousand people cycling round the town . you can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations .
then you can take route no . 5 . next i would suggest the international dragon boat race where you can watch lion dance , dragon boat racing , and many other water shows .
he's been compared to rimbaud , you know .
i have an idea for christmas this year .
let's not exchange any gifts at all .
hear me out . we can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it !
sybil . is that spelt with an i or a y ?
i'll see you in sterlet , then .
do you have a copy of our service contract with telecoms ? i'm not happy with their response time and i'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract .
what a lovely day . the sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . it's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan .

good idea . it is always cooler in a shade .

i like that . then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax .
i'm so excited . finally , a yard of my own .
i'm really curious . what is it like doing housework all day for a living ?
i still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . most women would rather hire a maid .
how ay clients do you have already ?
wow . too bad i don't have a clue about housework .
do you like flowers ?
what's your favorite flower ?
spring is a lively season .
i admire plum blossoms very much . it seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter .
it is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . i admire the bravery of plum blossoms .
what date is today ?
didn't you notice the roses everywhere ?
oh , god . i just forgot it . i should have brought roses for my girlfriend .
why are you so quiet ?
i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you'll feel better too .

sarah . you look terrible . what's wrong ?
i'm so sorry to hear that . when did this happen ?
is there anything i can do ?
i'm sure she knew you loved her . did she pass away in the hospital ?
i'm sorry she's gone .
i think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together .
when my grandmother passed away , i frequently visited her in the cemetery . i always talked to her . even though she wasn't there , i somehow knew she heard what i said .
it looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . we should get you something to eat .

i could get along fine without all the office politics .
there is a position i've had my eye on for several months now and i had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking .
we were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so ay new employees .
julia , what do you think of the network ?
yeah , you are right . internet makes our lives easier . but it's a two blade sword .

hi , jack , how have you been ?
why ? looks like you're feeling very down ! what happened ?
come on . for a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
oh , i'm sorry . i thought you two were made for each ocher .
jack , i don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
you don't look too well . what's going on ?

that's tough . what does your wife think about this ?
i have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . i'll see what they can do .
where are you from ?
where in china is guangzhou ?
how is everything going with your girlfriend ?

where are you going this summer vacation ?
do you want to go to the beach there ?
the same to you .
it's one of the highlights of the match .
the wonderful passing melaena did .
why ? in my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . the most important thing is participation .
i'm sorry to hear that . what's your conflict ?
did you think about talking to her again ? maybe she is waiting for your call .
a beautiful center !
oh , really ? that is great news . what does he look like ?
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
i hope the host team loses .
according to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in america .
what do you think of the former champ ?
no champion can remain at the top for ever .
what do you think of ac milan and the team of argentine ?
yes , i think ac milan's foot work is much better on the whole .
i've really enjoyed your party , lisa .

yes . our guest team is really tough .
we'll miss you while you're studying in the united states .
ok , hello !
nandu . nandu , how do you spell you name ?
what's the score ?
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
is the chinese team taking the lead ?
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
the phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket , it will enter the final .
in the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . how did you make it ?
is this your best score ?
i think he deserved his gold .
yes , it's perfect !
hey mike . what are you doing ?
i was just concerned about sam . he hasn't been himself lately .
that sucks . he must feel depressed .
why don't we take him out ? we can try to take his mind off of it . in the least show him that we're there for him .
ok . i'll call you back after i'm done .
which team won ?
what was the score ?
it's quiet everywhere in winter .
me too .
that's a good idea . let's go !
take care ! don't slip on the ground .
yes . very wonderful .
i'm sure he was off side .
i think he favors the host team .
hey . owen ! have you gone on your family vacation yet ?
didn't you bring his favorite toy ?
where did you go ? you've got a beautiful tan .
you must have had a great time . most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming .
his friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir .
which team has won ?
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
i like the kid . he's so lovely .
in spring , people are feeling refreshed . they take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . they feel they are full of spirits and energy .
well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . no one would like to stay in the open air for long .
i myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas .
and you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! people are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity !
well , it's hard to say . for the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , i think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year .
what are your hobbies , mr . green ?
i usually play chess with my friends . but i like playing basketball best .
no , i'm not very good at it . i play just for the fun of it .
oh , that's exciting . what does this guy look like ? is he hot ?
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
well , that's something i've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would say honesty .
what do you like to do in your spare time ?
what kind of dance do you like ?
great . i am not interested in chinese chess . it is too difficult for me .
ok , i will try . as for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ?
i like gardening . i take care of them everyday . i like those flowers and the swing in my garden . if the weather is nice , i would like to lie on the lawn .
mary , how was your date with john ?
oh , really ? that is great news . what does he look like ?
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?

i can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty .

hello , anna speaking !
i am fine . what have you been doing ?
that's great , congratulations !
how long have you been working there ?
how do you like your new boss ?
much better than the last one , huh ?
forget about him . come over to my house tonight . let's get drunk .
8 it is . see you then .
happy birthday , ann . many happy returns of the day ! here is a present for you .
ok , who is that girl ?
well , i don't know .
donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night !
yes ! we have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type .
where did you learn to sing like that ?
you ? wow . and why don't you ever dress like that at work ?
hi , jim and wendy . where're you going ?
here is a good place . let's get out .
mother nature is quite an artist .
amazing . the sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere !
are you free tomorrow , sam ?
what do you think of this suit ? do i look good or what ?
didn't they say we're going to the ritz ?
in that case , let me make a quick change into my street clothes .
ta da ! let's go to the ritz !
hey sarah . why are you limping ?
was it your first time ?
i remember the first time i went . my back was sore , i couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if i walked too fast .
it's only like that the first couple of times .
did you hear what happened to mike in accounts ?
he got arrested on friday night and spent the night in jail .
well , it was all a big mistake , actually . he got home on friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk .
yes , i think so .
no , she left him last year .
hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . where was i ?
oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . the neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police .
yes . so when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story
well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out .
what do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ?
oh man , i hate rejection . it really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person .
are you enjoying married life ?
do you guys do anything special ?
you are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? so what's it like ?
yeah , i know what you mean . the first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .
oh , so he's half chinese and half american . that's unusual . what languages does he speak , then ?
what does he look like ? can people tell ?
good afternoon , johnson .
did you hear what happened to mike last night ?
well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . typical , isn't it ?
hello , rebecca , fancy meeting you here !
how have you been ?
pretty good . what brings you here ?
did you have a good weekend ?
not bad . what did you do ?
hi , tony . haven ’ t seen you for a long time . how have you been ?
yes , i've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant .
well , $ 10 per hour , but i can keep the tips . that comes to roughly $ 80 every evening
there ’ s no rush . you can see him tomorrow . i ’ ve told him about you . he promised to give you the job .
think nothing of it , tony . i ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me .
first of all , you must be punctual . you should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . then , remember you should smile . smile to your customers all the time . never pull a long face even if you feel awful that day . anything else ? oh , yes . never argue with your boss . learn to say ' yes , sir . '
you may put it that way if you like . don ’ t worry . you ’ ll have no problem .
what ’ s the score ?
so baltimore is winning ?
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
the fans are great here , too . not like in philadelphia .
wow ! i can't believe i'm standing here !
i'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
i've seen it so many times in books , but i never imagined i'd get to see it in person .
maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ?
are you busy next saturday ?
i need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and i reply don't know what to get . will you come shopping with me ?
one of the girls in my office .
there is no specie occasion . she just likes to organize parties from time to time . this time it is a country theme .
well where am i going to get that sort of costume ?
oh good .
hello , janet .
and what is this ?
and when is your son's birthday ?
but mark's birthday is in april so i need to think about his present soon .
oh , my birthday is in december just before xmas so of course nobody remembers .
mmmm . i know ! we can go to a really bad sci fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . what do you think ?
i am going on my first date tonight . can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ?
yeah , that's a good idea . let me try it .
do i look more mature in the highheel shoes ?
i shall wear light make up instead of heavy . the face powder will lighten my skin color .
um , what will you do this weekend ?
a movie ? sure . do you know what's on right now ?
i'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night .
isn't there anything less expensive ?
but kids like watching things like that . it's just for fun , would't you say ?
i plan to emigrate to canada .
no . but it is said the welfare in canada is very good .
can i still get tickets for tonight's performance ?
hello ?
hi joe .
it's really cold . it snowed all day and the schools closed early .
it's 30 degrees now . it was even colder this morning .
me too . how's the weather where you are ?
i suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ?
give me scotch , please .
black rose .
just plain water with plenty of ice rock .
so emily , what do you like to do for fun ?
i also like going to the movies .
did you do anything fun over the weekend ?
why didn't you want to go out ?
did you download a movie or rent it at the store ?
last weekend i didn't want to go out either , so i stayed at home and played video games by myself . it was really fun !
yeah , i'm really into video games . in fact , all my friends are on the internet . i've never met any of them in the real world .
hello ?
i just got off the subway . i'm almost there . sorry i'm late .
where are you ?
should i come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ?
what ?
ok , see you soon .
it's my pleasure . actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . as for myself , i'd like to recommend gin and tonic .
good evening , sir . what can i do for you ?
how would you like your bourbon , straight or on the rock ?
here you are , sir . bourbon with iced water .
the bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . so the total is 16 . 5 dollars .
when do you usually go to the movies ?
the movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . i like to go to the movies during the week .
i like watching comedies , like ' boat ' . do you like watching comedies too ?
you like horror movies ? i don't like them because they're too scary ! i like comedies because i love to laugh .
well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . maybe we're just different kinds of people .
what's that ?
did you like the play ?
hi joe . you've met my new assistant , right ?
come on . she's like that with everyone .
it's snowing heavily .
the winter in ottawa is freezing .
it's almost christmas . what are you doing this weekend ?
well , i still haven't finished my christmas shopping . do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ?
friday's not good . i think the stores will be very crowded and i have to work .
yeah , that's fine .
233 331 8828 . let me give you my email address too . it's tom861@gmail . com
there is too much traffic in taipei these days , i think cars should be banned .
well , why not use buses or the met ?
why not ? there is nothing wrong with our buses and trains .
what are you doing over the weekend , sara ?
i want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . i'm not sure i'll be able to , though .
would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of new zealand ?
i see .
the canada day is on the 1st of july .
the national anthem of canada is ' o canada ' .
i immigrated here last year .
i agree , i had lunch there last week .
would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ?
that's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and i picked them .
evening .
stalls .
is there anything available for tonight ?
isn't there anything else available ?
lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?
so peter , do you have a favorite comedy ?
you know what comedy i really like ? ace ventura , pet detective . i think jim carry is really funny .
you talked like the terminator for two months ? wow , i think you liked that movie even more than i liked ' titanic . ' why did you like ' terminator ' so much ?
can you take part in our picnic this saturday ?
you like titanic ? that movie is so cheesy .
actually , i have to admit that you're right . i like some pretty cheesy movies too . i love arnold schwarzenegger action flicks , especially terminator .
will we drive to the seaside ?
let me help pay for gas .
what other expenses will we have ?
well now that i know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ?
i know ! i don't get them at all . but wait , isn't ' terminator ' a sci fi movie ?
good morning , you look very tired .
did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?
i don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges .
do you have much time watching tv ?
i don't like ads , either . but ads could bring big profits to the tv station .
what did you do over the weekend ?
do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?
like what ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ?
i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before !
did you watch the final last night ? my favorite singer won !
yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions .
me too .
yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
he really did a great job in the finale , especially in the pk round . he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
the air quality in this city is horrendous . the pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
they're related to one another , yes .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . they've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
hello
hi b . how are you ?
i called you yesterday . did you get my message ?
no problem . i wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . you're still coming to the wedding with me , right ?
yes . did you forget ?
that's good . i want to invite megan also . next time you see her , can you tell her for me .
yes , i think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . i'm not exactly sure how they know each other .
i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
hi jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ?
i need to be in the city centre this afternoon so i will be coming straight from there .
got that .
hold on , i am looking at the map now . ok , i can see horntown road . do i go straight at the intersection ?
ok , i can see that road .
good , i can see the library on the map .
craig , what do you do for work ?
what school do you go to ?
how long have you been studying english ?
i see . talking with other people is very important .
i'm having a party tonight at my apartment . you should come .
hi , sara , what are you reading ?
why ?
what for ?
that sounds cool . do you mind if i recommend myself for the job ?
yes , of course . but i only freelance on weekends with my uncle .
is your back door higher than the ground level ?
okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail .
don't worry . i will build your deck with a simple but classic look .
cedar is a good choice .
what's all the security check about , jimmy ? does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ?
i don't know . maybe the same . actually , this is my first time being in a bar .
sure . i love this place , especially the decoration . so tasteful !
yes , orange juice will be fine for me . but how can you get the drink ? it's so crowded there around the counter . you can barely move .
not everyone . but a lot of people do , especially the young . it's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends .
yeah , a dancing queen . wanna go and join them ?
ok . let me help you to hold the drink .
hi sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next friday ?
jane , susan , pete and two colleagues of mine from work .
susan suggested the one on main street . she says it is very good .
you know , the one just on the corner with oxford street . there is a large pharmacy next door .
okay then . i think we will all meet outside ?
at 8 o'clock . i will make the reservation .
why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ?
stop preaching your dream love marilyn monroe to me . i know those sexy women are your tastes .
do you know the highest mountain in the world ?
wow ! that must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth .
have people set foot on its peak ?
do you know something about mount tai ?
five sacred mountains ? why people call them so ?
got it . can we see any things left by them ?
i want to see them . how can i go there ?
i can see that . but why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? are you buying a house ?
can i have a look as well ?
oh , this one looks really good . and look at the garden . so beautiful .
yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . and it has a small balcony at the top .
talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ?
have you seen the new james bond movie ?
yes . what did you think of it ?
yes , i liked it , too . it was exciting , but not over the top . do you know what i mean ?
oh , yes . he's brilliant . did you like the title song ?
hum , edward norton , or something like that . did you like him ?
i don't know . i think the woman was better . she provided a good love interest . lucky james bond !
i hear you are expecting your family .
i didn't know you had a brother .
oh , nice . is he coming on his own or with the family ?
does your brother have just one son ?
i'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
so when are they all coming ?
hello , grace . that's a beautiful skirt you have on . where are you going ?
what kind of job are you applying for ?
oh . that dress doesn't exactly match the job .
did you have a part time job when you were still in school ?
yeah , i worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .
it was always very busy there .
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
have you found a new job yet ?
what kind of work ?
what do you do there ?
how long is the assignment ?
how many people are there in your family ?
that ’ s a big family . how old is your brother ?
what about your sister ?
do you miss your family ?
do you often go home ?
how often do you call to them ?
let's watch a movie or something .
i think they're playing lord of the rings
what type of movies do you like ?
that's an interesting combination . how about western movies ?
what should we do this saturday ?
yeah , but i don't know if it is going to be any good .
true . ok . let's see it this saturday .
want to meet for lunch this saturday ?
what kind of volunteer work ?
oh , yeah ?
dad , you keep talking about family in new zealand . who are they ?
is uncle bill your brother ?
so his two daughters are my cousins ?
what are step sisters ?
so uncle bill's wife is jane's mother but not sarah's mother . right ?
and when are they coming to visit us ?
did you see ally mabel last night ?
yes , wasn't it funny ?
sam , i am so sorry . it was your birthday yesterday and i completely forgot about it .
margaret really told me off when she found out that i had forgotten all about it . we did try to phone you , but you and jane must have gone out .
oh , yes , i know the one . how was the food ?
oh , no .
i would think this was the least they could do .
great . i have also been thinking of getting one . do you think you could ask jane to have a quiet word with margaret ? my birthday is not that far away .
you know ernie , it seems we both like the same artists .
but if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance . can you do that ?
how did you get into hip hop ?
who is your favorite hip hop artist ?
well , i've never downloaded music before . how does it work ?
alright . but why is downloading music better than buying cds at the store ?
i mostly listen to pop music , but i like a lot of different stuff .
what are the pop groups that you like ?
i agree ! i cried for a week when they broke up .
what about you , ernie ? how did you get into pop music ?
how did you meet your girlfriend ?
that's great . did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ?
do you remember john from head office ?
have you heard what happened to him ?
he had his car stolen . actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car .
well , apparently , he was just getting into his car he'd parked it in one of those underground multi story things he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in .
really ? well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . . we don't want to hurt you . we just want your car .
well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . the attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing .
yes , makes you think , doesn't it ?
well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away .
ernie , i'm really excited about starting this band together . we're going to be the two coolest students on campus .
that's a good question . you know i love hip hop , so maybe we can play some vanilla ice songs .
ok , i'm going to get itunes and download some vanilla ice songs .
when did you and amanda meet each other ?
so you met her right after you got to school ?
so you said you and amanda met through a mutual friend . how did it happen ?
did he tell you what she was like first ?
what about you , emily ? have you dated anyone recently ?
i had a terrible journey back from bangkok last week .
well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway .
well , i actually thumbed a lift .
yes , i stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport .
yes , except he drove really slowly , and i missed my flight .
yes , so i had to wait three hours for the next one . i didn't get home till four in the morning , and when i got home i realized i'd left my house keys in my hotel in bangkok .
i agree . i like guys that can make me laugh .
what's the time now ?
you've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? when do you usually wind it up ?
you got up so late today . you have , i think . turn on the tv and set your watch by it .
all right . it's just four o'clock .
do you want to hear a funny joke ?
well , you'll see .
ok , an englishman , a scotsman , and an irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them .
so they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment .
hang on , i haven't finished yet .
well , as i was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . the englishman had brought some water . if we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , he said . the scotsman brought a map . if we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . the irishman had brought a car door .
yep . a car door . why the door ? the others asked him . well , he said , “ if it gets hot , we can open the window . do you get it ?
wow , american football is more exciting than i thought .
oh , right . so , i can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on . who ’ s winning ?
wow ! what a hit !
is he ok ?
i guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
yeah .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
hey john , nice skates . are they new ?
what position do you play ?
yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . i play goalie , myself .
the rockets .
what ’ s the mountaineering club doing this weekend ?
how hard is the climb ?
what did you do last week ?
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i ’ m sorry i missed it .
i'm so bored . i don't know what i'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
that all depends on what you like to do . for example , i like to doodle on the notepad , so i'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
hi , john , how was your vacation ?
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
wow ! isn ’ t that dangerous ?
tell me about it .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
have any plans for the weekend , tom ?
oh , do you go hiking often ?
it would be nice to get out of the city . do you want some company ?
yeah , i go a lot too . i saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
yeah , my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
hello , mike , long time no see . how's everything going ?
he caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now .
who are those guys ?
oh .
all right !
wow , michael jordan ’ s slam dunks are beautiful things to watch .
which team do you think will win ?
do you have girlfriend ?
so i think i may fall in love with her .
then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ?
that's what i do .
yes .
that's it . she likes dogs so much now , and i begin to love dogs .
thanks , but i know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another .
so jen , what did you think of william ? did you guys have a nice time on your first date ?
you said all that on the first date ? alright . well are you two going out again ?
no problem . let's say 6:30 p . m . at the royal restaurant , ok ?
yes , i know . kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ?
oh , just on my own . i just joined , so i don't really have any partners .
16 . yours ?
jane . nice to meet you .
yes , it's fine . however , i personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . don't they have carts ?
oh , that's good . i guess the caddies were pleased .
yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ?
oh , my god , you're kidding me ! he carried him back ?
have you seen this ?
they killed another hostage .
i agree completely . i just don't understand what's wrong with them . don't they have any humanity ?
yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? just because they think so ?
come on , you can't be serious ! we should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ?
really ? what happened ?
william told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? what exactly did he say ?
it didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? what did you tell him ?
the weather is terrible .
i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
i saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .
i'm getting pretty bored . we should do something despite the rain .
i haven't been to the mall in a long time . let's go there .
great . i'll stop by your place now .
are you busy with your work ?
yes , i'm very busy , too . sometimes i work overtime .
yes , we won't travel again until october .
how's your work ?
not bad . but we have lost a few of staff lately .
because of the low salaries .
i don't know why .
it's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ?
good luck . i've got class in a few minutes .
are you travelling in america ?
what do you do ?
i know all the tricks of the trade . it is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted .
i am a reporter at a tv station .
yes , i have good working conditions and i would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year .
i report the social news which means i always interview the citizens of various professions and trades .
sometimes . news happened out of expectation . sometimes i have to get up in the early morning while i can't sleep for editing and interviewing .
nice day , isn't it ?
what are you up to tonight , steve ?
what time shall i pick you up ?
hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ?
how about legally blonde .
isn't that a scary movie ?
ok . i'll give it a try .
hi . you enjoying the party ?
yes . the drinks are very good ! i'm paul , by the way .
i'm in finance . you ?
t & d ? oh , yes , sure . how long have you worked there ?
hey bob . whatchy doing ?
that sounds so interesting . i wish i learned a hobby .
hey , ted . what are you up to this friday ?
that ’ s great ! do you have any plans ?
sounds nice .
can i stop by ?
a funny thing happened to me the other day .
i was just thinking about someone i went to school with , this boy i was quite friendly with in third grade . we used to hang out together he lived next door but then my parents moved and i changed schools and never saw him again .
well , i was walking down nan jing dong lu ( nan jing e . rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy i have no idea why i was thinking about him .
yes . and suddenly i heard someone call my name . i turned around and there was this man looking at me . i didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who i was .
have you seen the new hannibal letter movie ?
yes . what did you think of it ?
i liked it , too . it was scary , but not disgusting . i always enjoy watching anthony hopkins . he's brilliant .
hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?
well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
ok . i ’ ll take it .
do you have anything in the middle section ? i want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
where did you get your mobile ? it's really cute .
thanks . gee , it's really light !
yes , i like collecting antiques .
i don't know . i like this one , and i don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .
well , i just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . i find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? i mean , this camera function , for instance how often do you use it ?
well , that's nice i guess . so how many kids do you have ?
yes , but i bet $ 200 dollars on the cougars !
i can ’ t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure .
20 to 1 , in favour of the cougars !
hey joanne . what are you up to ?
i'm so bored . i don't know what i'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .
i don't think we are boring . it's just that we don't have any hobbies .
that all depends on what you like to do . for example , i like to doodle on the notepad , so i'm thinking about doing some real drawings .
yeah . that can be a good hobby .
thanks . sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . do you mind if i vent a little bit ?
great , because i am really mad at william . i mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb .
i haven't seen your father in like 5 years . how is he doing ?
why ? what's wrong ?
is it due to old age or is he sick .
that makes sense . it's important to take care of your health early in life .
it's snowing outside .
look at the snow , it's so beautiful .
i love winter , i love snow .
but i like cold more than hot .
i'm wearing my heavy jacket .
will it snow today ?
yes , when it snows , every where is white . it's very beautiful .
you see . the wage is not paid yet , i am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money .
well , i'm afraid i must be going now . i have no idea it was so late .
i'm afraid i can't . i have a dinner party at seven tonight . you see , i am going to england the day after tomorrow .
it has been a pleasure . goodbye .
do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?
how long does the rainy season last ?
i can hardly stand these wet and cold days . it seems that it doesn't bother you very much .
what do you do when you are angry ?
that ’ s smart . what do you usually do to relieve your anger ?
i think that might work for me as well .
like what ?
the time has come to say goodbye .
i've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .
you'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ?
what day is today ?
oh , today's international labour day . is it our working day ?
hello , jane !
hello , mary . how are you ?
life's so boring .
what do you think will make you happy ?
you heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness .
you'll get bored eventually .
well , jeff , that was a very productive meeting , i thought . you had some really great ideas in there !
no , i mean it . look , are you hungry ? shall we go get something to eat ?
ok , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner .
hi ! peter . how are you ?
mr . clinton , it's nice to see you again .
very well . how's mrs . clinton ?
it doesn't matter . forget it .
oh ! that's much hetter than i did .
there's no secret at all . the only thing for you to do is to practice more . you will succeed .
how old are you , su ?
i see , you have seven candles on the cake .
we will have a party here , right ?
rachel has decided to quit smoking .
you never guess she is going to have a baby .
yes , yes . she said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby .
have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ?
yes . is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ?
have you got any hobbies ?
which is easier to learn ?
hey ! what's up ?
yeah , i've been out of town .
have you considered upgrading your system ?
you could consider adding a painting program to your software . it would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising .
you might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now .
you'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . and you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . do you have a cd rom drive ?
then you might want to add a cd rom drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on cds .
hey , jack , where's your car ?
is that right ? this sure beats the old one ?
wow , this car can really burn rubber .
you made a perfect choice , jack .
how is your new car ?
why do you say so ? can i see your new car ?
wow , this new car is dynamite ! it is a shiny , beautiful car .
the car has very sleek lines . i love it .
how are your wedding plans going ?
when will your wedding take place ?
it will be a large church one . is your wedding dress ready ?
which hotel will the reception be held at ?
it's excellent . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
does your child still believe in santa claus ?
how sweet .
when are you going to tell her that santa claus doesn't exist ?
oh , mary , come in , please . i'm so happy to see you .
oh , thank you , mary . you're so nice .
they're all waiting for you . let's join them . i'm going to cut the cake soon .
hello , susan , it ’ s me , an .
i am fine . i am going swimming this afternoon . are you coming with me ?
maybe i can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together .
have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ?
i guess i was stunned for a moment , then i quickly ran away to get help .
when did you graduate ?
not for the others , but for me . i was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . he told me that i was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later .
yes . i went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting april fool , april fool .
i think it's about time that we had to go .
i'd love to , but i have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time .
thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality .
happy thanksgiving !
let's have pumpkin pie .
have a nice thanksgiving !
are you going anywhere ?
happy valentine's day !
could i treat you to dinner tonight ?
we have another traditional holiday the dragon boat festival .
it falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
ok . the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan . on that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
what is your hobby ?
what kind of reading materials do you like best ?
how do your spend your time after work or in vacation ?
but traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ?
any plans tonight ?
well , i am wondering if we took a hang out for a drink or something . you know , i just came back from a really tough interview . i was quite nervous during the interview . i really want to have the job . right now , i am still a little on the edge . i am not sure if i could convince them during the interview .
i don ’ t know . i think i did well in the paper exams . i was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as i expected . to my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the chinese poesy with me .
that new sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful .
i can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price .
such as ?
what does this mean ?
i can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing .
that's great !
have you bought another handset
this is silver gray , while i remember your handset was black .
how many cases are accessible ?
do you think the bad weather will last long ?
i hope so . we have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it .
some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them .
can short messages reach them ?
why haven't i thought of this skill ?
i am informed that many people used short messages to pay a new year call , and only on the spring festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ?
whose handset sounds so beautiful
are you able to compose music ?
who composed it for your ?
can i get on line to search one , too ?
what about my siemens ?
how do you like this dress ?
something attractive and dressy . maybe a little sexy too . new year's eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ?
before the new year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . on the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' happy new year ' . it's also common for people to make a new year's resolution .
it's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . however , it usually lasts only for a few days !
we're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . there's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . we all want you to come too .
it seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays .
cool ! what brand
what about the quality ?
i guess i'd better go now .
in that case , i'll be seeing you .
is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ?
well , i think i like it . i appreciate the snow very much .
by the way , where can i go ski ?
is he in ?
oh ! i just drop in on him for a chat .
it's time to leave the office for the night . firstly i log off my computer , then i set the electronic security system .
now i'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .
yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . please get in .
there's no need , i have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .
using gps i can rely on this to direct me home . now i just need to find my e card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out .
maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?
when i turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .
it's getting late , and i have to go now .
please excuse me , won't you ?
merry christmas , mr . wang . i would like to give you the book i specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days .
i hope it will be of some use to you .
hi , tina , i've got good news . i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company . they informed me to go to the final round next monday . it looks very promising .
thanks . let's go for a celebration this evening . are you free ?
no problem . see you !
could you tell me something about the mid autumn festival ? i find it also very interesting .
so , i understand why people eat moon cakes on that day .
is it official ?
how about seeing a play ? i hear hamlet is on at the national theater .
( looking at a newspaper ) oh , dear me ! there's no performance at the national theater this weekend . so we have to go to cinema instead .
let me see um . gone with the wind . it is on at six cinemas on saturday night .
ah . the royal , i think .
why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? it is convenient to us , i think .
do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ?
then , there's a 9:30 show .
i hope you will like it .
the spring festival is drawing close . by then we will have five days off . i am expecting it .
just like you celebrate christmas , we celebrate our lunar new year's day , the spring festival . it is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get together .
christmas has more religious nature , while our spring festival is a more traditional holiday . on the new year's eve , we have a big dinner called ' family reunion dinner ' . one of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . after that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching tv , or playing cards .
they usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks .
perhaps it is like what people told you . at 24 hours midnight , the time when the new year really comes , we exchange ' happy new year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' lucky money .
we are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
now let's get things ready .
what's that , a new video game ?
for instance ?
wow ! anything else ?
when will the ceremony begin ?
it's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding .
my best wishes to you and the bride !
mike's going to have a self driving traveling across the country .
you don't want to join him ?
what is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ?
when viewing the earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?
there're a lot of suspicions that the international space station is never going to become reality . is it going to be some future project that never happens ?
there were a lot of talks during the bush administration about a not too distant future mars mission . it seemed to fizzle out . do you think that this shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to mars sooner ?
you had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . how long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? i just can't wait .
are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ?
where do they go ?
they go to the home of the bride ?
the chinese custom is to go to the groom's home just the opposite .
that's very expensive for the family of the bride .
tell me something about the bridal bouquet . isn't it the custom to throw it ?
i'm reading an interesting report on mars .
absolutely ! it says there is water on mars buried beneath the surface . it's just a matter of how deep it is .
the soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . and it would need to be protected from the uv radiation .
i'm not sure nasa has built any portable habitats for extended stays on mars , but they have looked at various designs .
well , i'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . it's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4 . 5 billion years ago .
i'm skeptical . mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . it also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . it is so different from what we have on earth , you know .
is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ?
what a shame . will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ?
oh , ralph , i heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . disasters have happened before . if the spaceship were out of order . . .
but is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ?
what do you think is the real danger man faced in space ?
i want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert .
ordinary one , please .
i think they are too far from the stage . i want two in row 6 .
but i heard that our milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . if galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ?
wow , you're really informative . thanks a lot .
do you have anything to do after this ?
shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
i know a very interesting place .
two people chat on the net and step by step fall into love ! it's net love .
maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . he's called ' beast ' ?
i watched the screen display !
i hear you are moving to dalian .
well , we'll certainly miss you here .
i just got a letter from an old high school buddy .
he usually keeps me posted .
it's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much .
hi ! dear ! i'm waiting for you .
you know , although we've chatted twice , i've been thinking of you already .
& you ?
oh , thanks . i wanna see the real you .
ok ! before that i'll take this one as you .
me too . send you a kiss .
do you have a bf ?
why you say bf before ?
have you got a new one ?
i am single , i have no real of , only an e gf , that is you .
wow ! blablablabla . . .
i am so happy . i want to drink a cup of champagne .
it's ok , so i send you this .
it's my heart ; it's made of what you like .
are you sleepy ?
tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the web to find a mate ?
there are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . but how should you screen potential mates ? do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e mail ?
besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? are people out there finding true and lasting love through the internet
do you have any successful stories to share ?
how long have you been living in new york ?
where do your parents live ?
hey , frank , there is that janet chick .
and look out she's dressed .
no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants .
i think you've lost it .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
oh , hi , jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
then let's go in .
looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ?
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
did you enjoy that new movie ?
what ? i met him just before i took off from kitty's , he said he was coming .
i think that's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
doesn't sound promising .
if you want i'll let him know if i run into him .
it is really exciting news .
you don ’ t know ? the company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones .
this is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . the socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient .
what are your plans for this weekend ?
if the weather's fine .
i know a good place to hire bikes if you want .
hoo , i'm getting tired , jeanine , been a long day .
yeah , i know . shop till you drop .
i'm getting a little short on cash . let's just window shop a little .
hey , jeanine , get a load of that . it's beautiful .
you know i have a weakness for long dresses .
sure does . hey , can i sponge a little cash of you ?
for suspicion of driving under influence .
hi , mike , what gives ?
hey , great set of wheels .
who wouldn't ? wow , that's out of this world .
yeah , too cool . how much did they sold you for ?
i can imagine .
i'd love to .
what is your nationality ?
where is your domicile place ?
i am confused . how could a golfer need so many clubs ? seems to me , 14 altogether , right

so many ?
have you heard of tiger woods ?
where do you live now ?
which street do you live on ?
where are you living ?
how big is your family ?
who supports the family ?
do you live with your family ?

they must be amazing animals .

judy , your husband has a really nice car .
i didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ?
i see . it's almost 5:00 pm now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ?
yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . i always feel uncomfortable taking the subway .
doesn't your mother live in the city ?
i remember when she moved there . apartments were a lot cheaper then .
have a good time . next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker .
i went to jessie's birthday party yesterday . it was very good .
we ate a lot of things . we played games and gave gifts to jessie . we had a lot of fun .
my birthday comes next month . i want to hold a birthday party , too .
will you help me take these things to the car ?
bring them to my wife's car .
the blue suv in front of the honda .
that chair over there , but please be careful with it . it was a gift from my mother in law .
let me help you with that . i don't want you to hurt your back .
didn't i tell you ? we're moving to florida ?
what's your name ?
where are you from , sam ?
hello , steven . congratulations !
that's very good . it's said that marriage is the ab of love . but the words may not be right .
i just finished reading this article ' getting old gracefully ' . it's a very good article .
a lot of things . there is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . you really should read it .
why not ? what this article says makes good sense to me . if you read it , i'm sure you'll agree with me .
you are quite busy every day .
i see you sometimes work on weekends , too .
julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? anything special to celebrate ? did you get a promotion ?
oh , my dear , how can i forget such an important day ? i was just kidding . look at this box .
have a guess .
no .
open it now .

it's the tradition . but baby showers as we know them today were not common until after world warri .
so you will come , won't you ?
hello , tom . i'm really glad to meet you here .
i'm so surprised , b . why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ?
i didn't know that . i thought that you were happy together .
i can't believe it . but if you both determine to divorce , i hope you will have an amicable split .

time flies ! one year has already been a history !
yeah . have you made any good resolutions for this new year ?
i want to be healthier this year , so i think i should take more exercise .
maybe i should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess !
jim , i heard you took a trip to san diego . is that right ?
that sounds really nice . what did you do there ?

let's meet tonight at the thai restaurant at about 5 .
why don't you walk ? it's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening .
how did your vacation go ?
what about the trip ? do you enjoy yourself ?
did your boat float down the river ?
sounds dangerous .
nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be .
do you have brothers and sisters ?
i hate computer games .
because they are too violent . some of them are even disgusting .
it's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
it's exciting news ! if we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
will you come with me and help me choose ?
i think it's high time we had lunch .
i am sorry for that . i was so attracted by the beautiful scenery .
i think bill clinton is a good president .
yes , he is . of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t .

i stayed online chatting with friends all night . it was great fun .
who cares ? it's just online . it's not real . do you want to join me tonight ?
how can you manage to do both ? i mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
jim is a genius . he gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done .
everybody would like to have jim on their team . because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to .
quite a few people are laid off these days .
university graduates have difficulty finding a job too . there seems to be more and more competition in the job market
two people were robbed last night near the park .

what's the matter with you ? you don't look well .
have you heard of the love bug ?
yes . it is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . people say it will break out again om valentines ' day this year .

yes . we should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading .
but we need the wood .
do you say prayers before dinner ?
what is the biggest fun for you on thanksgiving ?
do you like being a doctor ?
can you tell me about it ?
what can you do when this happens ?
i'm steven , your neighbour .
nice to meet you , too .
i guess so . i live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then .
please come in !
oh , so nice of you to come here . have a seat . please make yourself at home .
thank you . my wife would be very happy to hear this .
i think john is the best player on the field .
do you have a park in the city ?
that ’ s great . we can go boating on the lake in the afternoon .
julia , i saw two men fighting beside our door this morning .
brothers ? do you know why they quarreled ?
is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ?
hi , mrs . henderson .
of course i have plenty of time . what's new ?
oh , maybe not . it's just your guess . do not give currency to idle gossip .
tom , i married julia last month . have you already known it ?
yes . however , i believe that marriage comes by destiny . i knew i would marry julia when i met her at the first time .
i am very interested in a new apartment near the taxing plaza , but the price is very high , i really can't afford it .
do you think i am rich enough to make it ? i am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . the real estate agency says if i pay a 25 % down payment , i can move in at once .
look at that . it's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
you are right . but what if an avalanche happened ?
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
congratulations ! mr . stuart ! you won the city marathon .
i watched the race with my children . we saw you run to the finish line . we all screamed with excitement .
i like to stay here .
people are very kind down your way . you ’ re lucky .
just make yourself at home .
wouldn't you like some more chicken ?
what about some drink ?
the idea about friday the thirteenth is totally ridiculous . i don't believe it at all .
why not ? the whole idea is superstitious .
where did you go yesterday ?
did you go shopping ?
oh , did you get a job ?
oh , it's getting late . i've got to run . it was nice talking to you , karren .
i guess we'll see each other around .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
you work upstair , right ? i think i have seen you before . i'm karren , karren brown .
i visited the polar aquarium today .
almost . there are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , people don't get much chance of seeing them .
absolutely . to be frank , i learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . i'm thinking of my kids there one of these days .
when do children start school in your country ?
but thats only in the cities , isnt it ?
let me see . how much should i pay for you ?
no , this will not do . let me see .
jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ?
what do you mean ?
i am fed up with jack . he is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt .
look , there are some words on the fish .
you can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .
just an animal ? but it has life too . if you want a tattoo , get one . it's your choice because you want it . but has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ?
john , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ?
yes . it says it will be sunny all day . no sign of rain at all .
okay . please take some fruit salad and crackers for me .
that's great . we can also take the dragon kite with us . after the picnic , we can fly it .
may , is this the hall of ancient china ?
why are they all in glass boxes ?
so there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
i wonder how old these things are . thousands of years ?
hey , look at the tripod . i've seen it on tv .
i ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up .
hi , sue . what's up ?
ok , i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
you know , just giving me lots to do . i'm really busy right now .
he is , but i didn't mean that . his daughter bought him a tie as a father's day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office .
the results of the poll show bill clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . do you find that interesting ?
hey , mike . can i ask you something ?
i'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
my husband is betting on france .
what do you mean ?
i think andy's party will be fun .
what's that ?
sure . oh , that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
something hot and spicy . they look very inviting on the menu . you are going to love them .
i'm not sure . i don't enjoy cooking that much . as long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
all right . i'm opening the window , though , is that ok ?
hello , tom . where are you heading for ?
another terror film ? there is too much terror and violence in the films . do you like seeing such a picture ?
happy birthday , mary !
here is a gift for you . i hope you like it .
i had my own ways of finding out . it's a secret . you look so beautiful today . your new shirt goes well with your skirt .
really ? it looks so nice .
all right .
no , thanks . i've had enough . now , mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . after that , you may cut the cake .
no , just a small one . next let's sing ' happy birthday ' to mary .
cheer !
so what time tomorrow ?
where to meet ?
ok . bottoms up .
it's on me .
adam , i'm sorry !
yes , but i couldn't help it . i was late getting off work for a start , and then i missed the bus . the bus i did catch got caught in a traffic jam . it was one thing after another .
yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters .
well , no . i thought i'd finish in about five minutes , and i didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . if it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , i wouldn't have been so late . i'm sorry .
could you tell me the right time , please ?
you'll have to get it fixed .
what is the correct time , please ?
when will the lecture begin ?
ok . goodbye .
i just dropped in to say goodbye .
i'll leave at 10 o'clock .
are you free tomorrow night ?
shall we have dinner together ?
yes , i do . i know a place that has excellent food .
what time is it , tom ?
is it ? i had no idea it was so late . i must be off now .
hi , dear , i've got your voice at last .
are you ok today ?
so do i . you are a beautiful flower in my mind .
thank you for coming to see me off .
if have time , i'll come again .
thank you for your hospitality . i hope i didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay .
did you watch tv last night , rose ?
what was it about ?
sure . i heard about this on the tv . on january 3rd , 2004 , explorer spirit landed near the so called guser crater . and three weeks later , spirit's twin explorer , opportunity , landed on meridian planum named by scientists .
sometimes i think television is too biased . none of them are completely objective .
newspapers or the radio i guess . i just wish tv was more objective .
the internet's a lot worse .
there's no one moderating it . anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . the information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . a lot of people get conned online .
who is your favorite nba star ?
kobe ? i know him , the key guy of the lakers , a heck of a nba player . he is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense .
maybe he is not good at rebounding ?
kobe came to beijing during this summer's olympics . did you go to the match between china and usa ?
well then , what are your spoils ?
hmm , what should i wear today ?
well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ?
loving to look beautiful is women's nature . in fact , i am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today .
how do you like this waltz ?
well , then , may i invite you for the first dance ?
me ? oh , no . in fact , i only took up dancing quite recently .
i'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it's lucky that i got you as a partner .
yes . and what dances do you like best ?
oh , well , the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
i do feel like a trip to florida on such a gloomy day in new york , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of florida .
but if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin .
would you like a cigarette ?
really ? why ?
i see . you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
what do you mean ? what are you talking about ?
who ? me ? could't give up smoking ? nonsense ! of course i could ! i know i could !
you went out on a date last night , didn't you ?
how come ?
why don't you phone her for a date again ?
don't jump to conclusions . look at the bright side , try to make another date again .
is that so ? we're using lures , and the fish are biting those too .
mary and tom are breaking up .
no , i don't think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
do you know who ammo hung is ?
you know only one aspect of him . do you know what he would do in the kitchen ?
in the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show .
excuse me miao li . could you tell me who jackie chan is ?
ha , i know cheng long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . and at that time he was promoted as the new bruce lee . but i'm not familiar with his english name .
some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ?
sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said ' everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
look at this , a brief introduction of hollywood .
what ? how much do you know hollywood ?
not bad . what kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s
mm . what came after that ?
pretty good . please continue .
the western films about america's cowboys , indians and early settlers .
since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . some people have also enjoyed watching psycho dramas about the everyday problems that people have .
now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie makers must see you in a completely different light .
then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed .
it seems to me that now you're famous . you've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties .
then fans don't see you much in public places .
a lot of people compare you to julia roberts . i wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' well , they've got something i could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . '
it seems to me that you are on very good terms with him .
he must be all over you the first time he saw you .
that means he was head over heels in love with you .
how did you first meet jack each other ?
and then ?
then he sent you to your home ?
it's a romantic meeting . i can say that a hero saves a beauty .
pretty ! say beautiful rather . can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether face and figure ?
i'll help you , lucy . look at what i've got here . in this small bottle , there's a magic love potion .
yes . if you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up .
take my word for it .
just come to our house and stay over . you'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' good morning ! '
i went to super junior's concert last night . it was fantastic .
the lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . can you sing ?
herman , why are you so excited ?
have you fallen in love ?
can you describe the situation at that time ?
what's her outlook ?
did you watch the premiership last night ?
no , it wasn't . rather , it looked like a bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . english league teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . it seems to me english soccer players are very gentlemanly . as diego maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it .
dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? i read the newspaper this morning . i know there is an art exhibition in taipei modern art museum .
i don't think so . i think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting .
look at the ticket booth in the center . there seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be .
good idea .
i have no idea . let me take a closer look at my museum map
it's on the 2nd floor . we are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient greece .
which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this world cup ?
no , they aren't . they had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth finals with wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . just think , group a consists of austria , china , and saudi arabia , all of which are minnows .
well , at least the germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . they recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against austria . and they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . i think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later .
that's why i still have very high hopes for the team . now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock out stage , the germans will probably make it through to the finals .
what do you think of smoking ?
what in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?
how about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ?
are you a smoker ?
would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
when did you begin to smoke ?
might i ask if you have tried to give up smoking ?
i tell you i must go !
tomorrow is sunday . let's go out and get some fresh air .
why not ? i love animals and i love nature .
sounds very interesting . i can't wait to go there .
well , now you know . let's go to the lake over there . some people are fishing over there . i haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , i really want to try .
yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . who do you think will catch a big fish first ?
wait and see . i want to try horseback riding after fishing . it looks very exciting and fun .
i have a sweet tooth . i can not help but think about having something sweet between meals .
that sounds really attractive . let's go to that candy shop now .
they have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . they are in different colors and flavors .
me too . i finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people .
you are a candy terminator . be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .
did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? the person who wrote that must be crazy .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good .
i've brought a little dog for alice , girls usually like looking after pets .
to tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . i want to ask alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend .
oh , it's so . she looks very lovely . could you give me some else information on her ?
how do you think about her ?
i'm wondering if she has boyfriend .
you look a bit dull today . what's up ?
yeah , it's true . what is she going to do ?
that's not bad . it could be a short term alternative . your mum can look for another one when the market improves . things will work out eventually .
do you know his sister ?
that's right .
well .
i guess i don't earn enough .
so how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?
i'm not disciplined enough i guess .
hey , jeff , where's your stereo ?
you must have been really hurting for cash to have done that .
it sounds like you weren't expecting that .
well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , i can loan you some .
what colour is her hair ?
what , curly ?
does she wear glasses ?
that one looks pretty big . are you going to keep it ?
not me . i like to throw back what i catch .
my daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . she says she wants to get a better job with higher pay .
but what about settling down to start a family ? doesn't anyone want to get married any more ?
what time is the right moment ?
hey , buddy . are the fish biting today ?
is that so ? well , what kind of bait are you using ?
lures ? we're using live bait over here .
we're using worms .
no , we haven't even gotten a nibble today .
i would , but i don't have any in my tackle box .
i'm just fishing from the shore . how about you ?
sweet . can you tell me where it is ?
do you think that's a good spot ?
thanks . i think i'll go check that out now .
i don't know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ?
you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .
in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls .
are you still busy today ?
fine , honey . rome couldn't be built with in one day .
millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information .
it's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines .
well , for example , the wall street journal is very , very good . even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin .
good . fortune is usually ahead of the curve . and business week is very solid , too .
a good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases . their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc .
what's your favorite hobby ?
what kinds of books do you like to read ?
by the way , would you like to see movies ?
what do you do in your spare time ?
i just like to sleep like a lazy cat .
they are a nice middle aged couple , just like us .
of course they are .
oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . that's all .
oh , fool ! you're nearly seventy and i'm in the low sixties . would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ?
hello , mr . black , i'm calling to say goodbye .
yes , i did .
at 11:00 o'clock .
no , i'll go by myself , thanks .
you are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .
do you have many friends ?
what do you usually do in your work time ?
are you usually busy ?
what depends ?
how many persons are there in your family ?
do you live together ?
do you often go back to see your parents .
i often go to a place of leisure .
i very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine .
the coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there .
i may take you there some day .
good afternoon , sir . may i help you ?
what's your name , please ?
i'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening .
nonsmoking , please .
my surname is gao .
would you like to stretch your legs ?
let's get a soft drink .
it's a fifteen minute intermission .
it's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great .
is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ?
do you have large concert halls in your city ?
hey , you can dance to rap music !
yes , sir . for how many people , please ?
what time ?
so sorry , we're fully booked in that room . would you like to make reservation some other time ?
hello , could you arrange a dinner for us ?
eight o'clock tomorrow evening .
chinese food .
no , not too lavish .
what is the usual thing here ?
let's say sixty yuan then .
we'd like to have typical chinese food .
no snakes , please .
mao tai and qingdao beer .
right , thanks .
would you like to book a table , sir ?
sure , when ?
for how many guests , please ?
how much would you like to spend ?
ok .
eight .
did you see the 2005 grammy awards on tv last night .
he seems to win awards everywhere .
i heard one observer even said ' it was a song sung in spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the americans loved it . '
good morning . sanyu restaurant . may i help you ?
we open at 6:30 , sir .
fine ! i'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . may i have your name , please ?
thank you , mr . davis .
i see . we have already received many bookings and though i can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , mr . davis . i hope you'll understand .
we'll try our best .
okay , show me your card hand . here's mine . i have three kings and a pair of aces .
thanks again for buying the tickets . that was the most exciting live concert i've ever seen . that silver electric guitar was really cool .
that , my heart will go on . it warms my heart . you know , janetjackson , shanna twain and celine dion are so very different .
excellent . you can borrow my janet jackson's cd . it's her new one .
what was the last movie you saw ?
really ? i've seen that movie , too .
i thought it was pretty good .
you're kidding . the story and acting were outstanding .
yeah , that's the one i've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding .
wasn't that a great flick ? i was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie .
well , i'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards .
okay . but you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending .
oh , really ? how does the book end ?
i know you are a good dancer . what dances do you like ?
why do you like old styles of dance ?
i think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll .
people of different races are fit for quite different sports . for instance , asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . they seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable .
yes , in all these four sports . the chinese olympic dream teams led the way . they swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving .
i think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc .
it's common sense that african athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon .
how is night life in beijing ?
what do you suggest then ?
that's a great idea . let's go . oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful .
that's great ! i love to dance to fast music .
yes , disco dancing is my favorite . it ' s great fun and good exercise as well .
now the band is playing a slow dance .
sorry , i think i'il sit out the next dance .
may i invite you for a dance ?
you dance well . do you breakdance ?
there's a story about breakdancing in the paper .
according to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style .
well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance .
right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music .
how do you like this waltz ?
me ? oh , no . in fact , i took up dancing quite recently .
i'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . it's lucky that i got a partner .
oh , well , the music has stopped . thank you for the dance .
what's your favorite sport ?
is the entrance charge expensive ?
haha , jogging ? perhaps it might be a bit too boring ?
shall i light the stove ?
well , what's the climate like in your country ?
which season do you like best ?
i've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year .
the weather in beijing is just beautiful !
yes , i can see . the summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away .
autumn is also very nice in washington .
no , it isn't . but sometimes it snows a lot in winter .
oh yes ! sometimes it rains very heavily . how about here in beijing ?
i feel it's rather dry here .
are you from the south ?
i really like the record you lent me the other day .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
i'm most grateful . everyone in our class enjoyed it .
i wish i could , but it's already late .
thank you for a wonderful meal .
if you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes .
how'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ?
don't worry . it is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . just to finish it is considered a victory for most .
i'm afraid i've got to go . i have another appointment at five .
no problem .
it seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . that is what a good salesman needs . good luck .
i guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye .
how do you usually sell your products now ?
oh , really ? is it a good way ?
what advantages does it have ?
yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time .
yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . but does it have any disadvantages ?
you mean there may be credit problems ?
will you give some suggestion ?
how do you shoot pool ?
and ?
how do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ?
can i get the black ball in ?
hi . have you got a personal computer ?
i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
is the service charged ?
hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight .
today more and more families have personal computers . people have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world .
one of the common uses of pc is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores .
if a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . and then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . the service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge .
i'm better now . want to play again ?
let's get all the balls out of the pockets .
what are you doing for christmas this year ?
that's great . m ost of my family is coming home too .
my sister . she is going to her in law's house this year .
i hope that i get what i asked for .
we wake up early and go to church . then we come back home and open our gifts together . how about you ?
( before christmas party ) are you ready for the christmas party tonight
use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine !
i've already got mine .
here ! open mine first .
did you get a nice tree ?
let's put it over there .
let's string the lights first . then we won't have to mess up the decorations .
there , . we're about done .
ok . here goes .
we ’ re going to the dragon boat festival tomorrow . feel like coming along ?
really ? i think you ’ ll love it .
these days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . he plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . the funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . i wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life .
that's exactly like my wife . she spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft ware standards .
hey , tom . you look tired . are you all right ?
how come ?
don't you like games
me too . recently , i've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them .
i'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
hi ! i'm happy you could make it .
what can i get you ?
good evening , i'm so happy you could come .
what would you like to drink ?
come in . it's nice to see you again .
would you care for a drink ?
we are doing ' secret santa ' at the office again this year .
i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ?
do you know what the bbs is ?
tell me then .
oh , i see , but what's it used for ?
tell me in details .
oh , that's great . i want to try later .
i'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations .
interesting . then what does h & k refer to ? the city of hong kong ?
really ? what kind ? a girl left this word to me , and i thought she was in hong kong .
hug and kiss ? ! how is it possible ? oh , it's really bad to miun verstand her meaning .
did you listen to the weather forecast ?
there's a typhoon coming .
what are you doing ?
you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?
i guess the games i like the most are the ones that i'm good at !
well , i like to play darts . whenever i go to a bar , i usually play for a few hours .
my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . we used to have family tournaments every weekend .
some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried that ?
how about mah jong ?
what did you do last night ?
did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game ?
what were the results of the game ?
what was the actual score ?
really ? i thought barcelona was going to win . they are a much better team than madrid .
what happened ?
that explains it .
that was the last game before the playoffs .
me , too ! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? i'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
did you watch the oscars on sunday night ?
yes , that was surprising . i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
did either one of them win an oscar this year ?
tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
what happened ? why didn't he win ?
how did that happen ? he's so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
guess what ! i know something you don't know !
how many planets are there in the solar system ?
not anymore ! can you believe it ? they've decided that pluto is not a planet anymore !
yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .
we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos .
i suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .
i hope not . i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the earth .
what date is it today ?
don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ?
how about going to a concert ?
hi , long time no see . how have you been ?
oh , i see . what makes you think that ?
really ? what happened ?
i see what you mean . i understand why you're concerned . have you tried talking to your son about it ?
you may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life .
hey , what's up ?
what were you writing ?
you mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? you big chicken !
but , you work with her everyday .
you've dated a lot . what's so different about diana ?
i was looking for you to deliver this note from diana . she wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night .
sorry . what can i say ? now , do you want the note or what ?
have a great time tomorrow night .
hello . may i speak to mary , please ?
hi , mary . this is tom .
just fine . i say . aren't you busy tomorrow evening ?
well , uh . why not dine out together and go to the movies ?
okay . i'll pick you up at 6:00 .
does your girl friend like swimming ?
then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke .
really ? then just ask her to follow me .
yes . but i still have some difficulties it breathing .
to tell you the truth , i have never thought of being a swimmer . i swim just for fun .
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ?
i think you're being a little critical . the actor in the lead role is fantastic . i suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though .
actually , the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine .
that's only part of it . i absolutely adore this director . every play he works on turns out great .
quite a few actually . by the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . my friend has invited us . do you want to go ?
i've never had a part in a play before , but i used to be a part of the stage crew in high school .
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
why not ?
get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . what a life ! i've had enough of it .
what should i do then ?
could you come and spend the weekend with us ?
good morning , jerry . how's everything ?
doing anything for lunch ?
merry christmas !
are you doing anything special ?
do you have any plans ?
please excuse me , but i really have to be going .
bob !
fine , just fine . and you ?
do you like swimming ?
me too . swimming is a very good exercise for health . it combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . it promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems .
have you ever swum in a river or a lake ?
how do you like these dishes ?
did you enjoy your dinner ?
would you like some more rice ?
another piece of meat pie ?
how about the dessert ?
congratulations on the new house !
what are you and corey doing for valentine ’ s day this friday ?
you have to do something romantic .
well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !
what are you doing this saturday ?
do you want to go see a movie ?
what's playing at the century fox ?
should we go see it ?
how about ‘ run of the mill ? ’
why don't we go to a concert instead ?
another glass of beer , will you ?
at least one for your trip .
happy mother's day , mom !
of course i should have ! you certainly deserve them ! you put up with all of us .
have you gone bowling before ?
there are 10 frames in a bowling game . each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame .
' round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms .
you keep bowling spares but no strike .
the problem is you are too nervous . you want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . and when it comes to the i second roll , there's no pressure . that's why you could bowl all those spares .
are your ready to go to the supermarket ?
i've got my money and my keys , so i'm ready .
have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ?
that's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it .
how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ?
maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse .
good idea . that will help us to warm up .
i usually bowl with an eight ball . i like the control of a light ball . i can spin it more , so that the ball hooks .
well , let's see which technique is better . i think i'll go up first . yes ! i hit a strike . i knocked them all down on my first bowl .
good start . you knocked eight pins down . but you are left with a 7 , 10 split . unless you can bowl a ufo ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible .
may i know how old you are ?
what is your date of birth ?
when and where were you born ?
you look so young .
hey , tom , i want to learn how to play golf .
what kinds of clubs ?
i'll buy a set . but you have to teach me .
this little wooden stick is called a tee .
pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers .
not too bad . the goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible .
where is your native place ?
so are you a local ?
i'm sorry , sam . i don't want to go to the folk concert .
i don't like going to the theatre .
travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . and you ?
i like talking to you , too .
where did you go yesterday ?
how often do you play tennis ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
who won ?
what was the score ?
do you like traveling ?
where did you visit ?
how did you like it ?
why did you go there ?
and do you have friends there ?
you must have enjoyed yourself .
and , is it what you found ?
isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ?
could you move smoothly ?
what happened afterwards ?
how do you like skiing , pat ?
i suppose skiing is easy for you .
i see . do you ski often ?
that sounds great .
not on your life ! i know i'd break my leg
hi , monica , how is everything going ?
why ? you ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
it seems that you get antsy when you hear i praise another guy .
how come you think of him that way ?
i have no reason to distrust him . he's never caused any harm .
nothing smells a rat . i told you that he's an all right guy .
are you free this weekend , miss rose ?
then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
oh , no . as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .
thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot , right ?
what's your favorite dance ?
how about rock'n'roll ?
and the tango ?
don't be so modest . i'm sure you can do it very well . then i'll meet you at six . is that at all right ?
lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ?
the weather is really nice today . let's walk .
alright , then let's take an umbrella . is your brother coming with us ?
wow , it's already 10:00 am . he must have been up late last night .
i hope he can come later .
how do we get to the library from here ?
david , what have you been up to lately ?
really ? where did you go ?
what cities did you go to ?
did you go to berlin ?
i think this summer is a good time to visit berlin . it's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .
i went there last year . if you want , i can give you some information i have about the city .
are you sure lucy has it bad for you ? if she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . but if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her .
and do you really love her ?
how do you think should i handle this problem ?
but i'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss .
she's always bothering me . what should i do ?
but she always harps on me .
i'm afraid i spilled coffee on the tablecloth .
can you tell me the time ? i've got an appointment at 8: 30 .
by the way , could you tell me what day it is today ?
and the date , please .
it looks like it's going to be sunny .
they say we're going to get some rain later .
what time do you have ?
i must be off now . i'm pressed for time .
but sue is indeed beaut . men can hardly resist such a knock out .
hello , my name is bill martin and we have a reservation for party tonight .
i need to cancel that . we have had a last minute change of plans .
ok , we will let you know as early as possible . by the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ?
thank you very much .
how are you doing , christopher ?
are you doing anything this weekend ?
are you available on sunday ?
ok , well , my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday . we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . do you want to come with us ?
it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
do you like surfing ?
we've got a few . i can teach you how to surf on sunday . it'll be fun !
hi , steven ! what do you like to do during the weekend ?
that ’ s great ! i think they do you a lot of good .
but why do you choose cycling at first ?
julia , will you be my wife ?
please , julia , i have made proposal to you five times . i really want to share the rest of my life with you .
julia , i really love you . i hope i can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future .
so , will you marry me ?
who is looking after him ?
you really are lucky !
let's get together this weekend , is that all right ?
when is it convenient for you ?
could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ?
never mind . i'll be waiting for you .
would you honor us with a visit ?
when will you be convenient ?
are you doing anything tomorrow ?
i'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ?
have you been ever been to disneyworld ?
the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland , so you must have been to disneyland .
well , i've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
some time next year . we haven't set the date yet .
thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ?
for the most part , yes . some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
thanks for the advice . i'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
when will our party be held ?
have you sent out invitations by our party ?
could dr . cole like to attend the party ?
good morning , paul !
yes , traffic wasn't much today , so i made it to the office earlier .
well , about an hour or so .
no . i take public transportation . it's safer .
may i have a word with you ?
when will you be free ?
shall i say around ten o'clock ?
are you free this saturday evening ?
at our club .
at 7:30 p . m .
wow , is that your sports car ?
i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ?
what's wrong with it ?
when's the last time you had it serviced ?
i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis .
what else is wrong with it ?
anything else ?
what's wrong with him ?
is he getting better now ?
the help is mutual . i must thank you to see me off . my wife and i will be looking forward to seeing you . you will come to see us , won't you ?
annie , what is troubling you ? you look unhappy .
do you like him ?
then why are you hesitating ?
one love drives out another . you shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship .
would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
we'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
what a pity ! you can't join us .
ye ting , who are these people in the picture ?
so you have two brothers ?
hello ! so you are leaving today .
it is my pleasure to see you off .
i hope so , too .
don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ?
if i do try to do anything , i ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear .
why ? i mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ?
come on , buddy , cheer up . why not do some sports with me ? violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love .
are you working or are you a student ?
which school are you studying at ?
nick , it's very nice of you to see me off .
very well . if i leave i'll miss you .
it's time i left .
do you live with your parents ?
how often do you go back to visit them ?
well , i thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . that is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
i'm sorry i was such a grouch . it must've been the weather . when it rains i get depressed .
never mind , i can teach you .
no , it is easy .
you just follow me .
yup , because dance can relax myself .
hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight !
nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ?
we haven't played chess for a long time . how about playing chess ?
don ’ t worry , i will teach you how to win .
see you tomorrow .
harry is a hen pecked husband .
then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ?
i have never you mention this friend . are you on very good terms with him or her ?
you must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease .
have you enjoyed your weekend ?
we'd like to invite you over for dinner this friday evening . can you come ?
yes . we hope you'll be able to join us .
good !
has robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?
do you know why ?
how's your business ?
things are tough all over . you should never give up !
i think you should make a thorough market investigation now .
i always consider you are such a guy who never gives up .
but he is not someone who can be led by the nose .
are you ready to go the concert ?
actually , why don't we go there by bike ? we could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .
maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
is that your new bicycle ?
it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . these are really expensive !
i can fix those for you . is there anything else wrong with it ?
that's easy . it's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
hey , blake ! are you still listening to mozart ?
it's great . and i ' ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
is classical music your favorite ?
i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i can't get fully relaxed in it .
yeah , that's why i can enjoy myself in it .
oh , i didn't know you can play the violin . do you still play .
well , how was your honeymoon ?
peak periods always entail hours of queuing . at least you got a nice tan though !
my friends and i just got back from bali .
yes , we were lucky . my friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free .
i took a few diving classes , but i didn't really like it , so i did snorkeling instead !
i've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . i'll show them to you next time i see you .
we're planning on going skiing in switzerland . do you ski ?
would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ?
lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life .
what if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ?
when i ’ m old , i ’ ll also be like that .
how are you ?
good . do you speak english ?
yes .
i'm from california .
do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?
how does 7:30 sound ?
how about going to hear a country and western singer tonight ?
i'll pick you up around 8: 00 .
excuse me , what's your name ?
thank you .
sure . it's 5:10 pm .
i said it's 5:10 pm .
would you like to go to a party tonight ?
hi sarah , how are you ?
ok .
i'd like to go to an italian restaurant .
i like spaghetti . do you like spaghetti ?
do you know that song ?
the song you hear now .
elvis presley . don't you recognize his voice ?
why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?
let's say about 6:00 ?
because . i heard john got married yesterday .
no , he didn't tell me about it . don't feel bad .
what day is today ?
tomorrow is friday . it's going to be the weekend .
i don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else .
it depends on where you are and what position you are in . for instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable .
i cannot see eye to eye with you here . you see , i am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . i mean , they smile for no reason at all .
guess who i saw yesterday ?
avril lavigen !
yeah , i worked as temporary staff in her concert . look , her poster , a cd .
not really . but i like some of her songs . she's actually very talented . she's a song writer and fashion designer , too .
yeah , though i don't think her acting skills are that great .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
no , there were too many people . when she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs .
so you are green with envy at your neighbor ?
but i don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . that ’ s not the whole life .
some people are easily flimflammed .
they are blind with bucks . blind people are more easily conned , fo course .
charlotte , have you had your supper ?
why ? don't you feel well ?
what's up ?
you must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing .
you'd better shape up if you want to get the job done .
oh , come on ! just a quick one !
which day would suit you ?
how about thursday ?
oh , about 6:00 . will that be ok ?
i have a suggestion . why don't we go to a etv and sing ?
yes , why not ? don ’ t you like etv ?
never ? really ? i'm surprised .
but there are a lot of kts in this town . there's one just two blocks from here .
may i have an appointment with you tonight ?
ok . where and when ?
someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot tempered .
why don't you have dinner with me tonight ?
let's say about 6:00 ?
mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! it is so simple yet so vivid !
yes , it is . how do you know that ?
cool ! what kind of chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate style painting ?
that's true . chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of china's traditional culture .
so do i . let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ?
do you feel like going to see paul and claire tonight ?
how does 7:30 sound ?
are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ?
titanic is playing tonight . it's a blockbuster .
ok , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . don ’ t be late .
( after watching the movie . ) are you crying ?
tragic movie ? i think it's a love story .
ah , you're just too emotional .
i haven't seen bill lately . how is he ?
that's too bad . what does he have ?
let me know if there's anything i can do .
do you know mark ?
can you introduce him to me ?
where did you go yesterday ?
how often do you play tennis ?
i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball .
i usually play with my schoolmates .
yes , i went to the than he sports center for a football match last sunday .
hi mark .
what are you planning to do today ?
would you like to have lunch with me ?
is 11:30 am ok ?
i said , 11:30 am .
ok , how about 12:30 pm ?
it's on 7th street .
i can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision . you cannot find a better one .
no . but i ’ m sure she is a good girl . my sixth sense tells me so .
how's your brother doing ?
i'm sorry to hear that . what's the matter ?
hello , mary . nice day , isn't it ?
i do feel like an outdoor exercise . after all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time .
ok . it's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh .

where's tom this evening ?
tell him i was asking about him .

where ?
that's nice . how old are you ?
i'm sorry , but i can't find the book you lent me . i guess i have lost it .
i really feel bad about it . let me buy you a new one .
it seems to be clearing up .
i really don't think this weather will last .
beautiful day , isn't it ?
i wish it would stay this way for the weekend .
how's the weather today ?
i really don't think this weather will last .
i think it's going to be a nice day .
but it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon .
jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ?

how about tomorrow night ?

how about the korean restaurant next to it ?
john , my father isn't there at all . are you kidding ?

i really hate this weather .
what will the weather be like tomorrow ?

julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
oh ! i hate rainy days !
yes . i have to drive to washington d . c .
yeah ! but you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . maybe tomorrow is a clear day . who knows ?
oh , the ink is spilled on the desk .
no , but the table cloth was dirty .
i'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain .
john , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ?
i had the same experience with you . when i was a little boy i dreamed to be a great scientist . but now you see , i'm just a common office clerk .
i do . and now i'm working hard to learn english , and i want to be an interpreter some day .
john , you look pale . what happened ?
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned ! maybe i can help you !
is there anything i can do for you ?
i know your feeling . take it easy and say something to me if you like .
i feel terrible , but i've just broken your ashtray .
i don't know what to say . i'd like to replace it .
really ? how long have you been playing the violin ?
that's really interesting .
well , i like collecting matchbox ! i'm not sure if that counts , though .
do you object to drinking black tea , mr . zhang ?
do you drink green tea , then ?
but if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good .
not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired .
why is it so ?
brian , do you know how to speak english ?
where did you learn ?
how long have you been in the u . s . ?
is your wife with you ?
have you been to california before ?
i hear you have just shown your hand first to lin ping .
if i were in your position , i wouldn't give up an inch .
hi , jenny . you look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . where are you going ?
that's great . we can go to the bank together .
not really . i plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the atm in japan .
hey , how's it going ?
oh , that's too bad . was it stolen ?
is there anything i can do ?
sure , how much do you need ?
that's no problem .
i'm going to buy some books and then i'm going to the gas station .
will you be joining billy and i at the bar ?
we are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th street .
i want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so i should be there by 9 pm .
certainly . but if there are going to be four of us , i had better make reservations .
not that i know of . why do you ask ?
i hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced . you should be fine .
no , its very casual there . leave your jacket and tie at home .
i'll see you there at 9pm .
you seem to be very tired .
why don't you join us to go out for a walk ?
we seem to be lost here .
i suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman .
steven , why are you so depressed ?
what's the news ?
it's horrible .
yes . how about donating some money ?
just find the answer through internet .
steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ?
you look so upset . what's going on ?
oh , what a pity !
is it that bad ? it ’ s nothing more than a game .
oh , come on ! failure is the mother of success . don ’ t lose heart . i'm sure you'll succeed .
well , i'm thinking of going to see the ballet swan lake by the famous russian national ballet troupe this evening at beijing grand theater . why don't you join me ?
you always work too hard , jim . as the saying goes , all work and no play makes jack a dull boy . you should spare some time for a rest .
that's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry .
did you see the fashion awards last night ?
not interested ?
but they are showing what will be all the rage next year .
did you know that fashion is cyclical ?
precisely ! for example , flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . now we can start to see them coming back in again .
they're also known as bell bottoms . they are a type of trousers .
maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it .
why don't you try to give it up ?
susan , did you know the four ugliest women in ancient china ?
there were some famous ugly women in history .
though they were ugly , they had great virtue .
mo mu , thong lichen , meng gang and ran nv . they were well respected .
jeff , i'm going to the supermarket . do you want to come with me ?
oh , when does it close ?
alright . what do you want to do now ?
where does she live ?
how long has she lived there ?
that's a long time . where did she live before that ?
you look tired . did you sleep well last night ?
charles , do you have any children ?
how many children do you have ?
what are their names ?
how old are they ?
are they in school ?
what does stephanie study ?
is she here now ?
give me your hand . ( takes rose's hand ) close your eyes . go on . ( rose closes her eyes ) step up . now hold on to the rail . keep your eyes closed ; don't peek .
step up onto the rail . hold on . keep your eyes closed . trust me ?
all right , open your eyes . ( rose opens her eyes . she stretches her arms , and jack stands behind her , arms around her . )
do you like tea ?
tea does good to people's health . there are many kinds of tea . say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , jas mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on .
can you believe me ?
please count on my love .
i'll be yours through endless time .
thank you . i know i've nothing to offer you , but i'll never give you reason to cry .
my love will grow , like a river to flow .
i don't know whether we are in a dream .
what good sunshine ! let's go and get a suntan on the balcony .
it's different in my case . i work in the office , so only rarely do i get the chance to get any sun .
we'd like a half day package .
how many can we choose ?
we'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage .
that was heaven !
really ?
hey , joshua ! is anny coming with us ?
nothing . i'm just asking .
who has a crush ?
i'd totally die if she turned me down .
happy anniversary , sweetheart !
i'll drink to that . thanks for making this a night worth remembering .
that's good to know . oh , listen ! the band's playing our song .
flowers for my favorite girl .
that's a secret . here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way .
fine , what do you call this ?
really ? thank you . i am thinking the same thing about you .
rose , the weekend is coming . let's discuss what we will do .
sounds good . but on saturday there's a football final .
let me see . we can visit the country . we haven't done that for such a long time .
what a nice dress , jean . you look marvelous !
from the crown's . oh , what lovely earrings you have ! are they diamond ?
well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married .
she's chic , isn't she ?
it makes me feel rather shabby . that woman has a good taste in dressing , i would say .
most women follow fashion like sheep . they don't know any better than imitate .
the gown is quite expensive , believe me .
you know those upstarts . they're all show offs ! i think i'd better have a diet ; otherwise i'd look like a ballon soon .
at the beijing olympics , all four table tennis events were all chinese finals . a clean sweep again !
do you know any secrets to china's success ?
so , the national ping pong team must be a highly competitive membership .
for example ?
oh , dear ! it's an encroachment on individual rights !
hi , bill . i saw you yesterday with a pretty girl .
are you sure she is the right girl ?
what type of girl is she ?
can we stop here for a while ? my backpack is very heavy .
let me see . it's not an eagle . i think it's a vulture .
i also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . if you are hungry , you can let me know .
well , it is a birch tree . it is not as old as you think .
sarah , what did you do today ?
did you buy anything ?
what did you buy ?
yeah , i like it a lot . it's very pretty . where did you buy it ?
that's cheap .
paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ?
i have tickets to a show . do you want to go with me ?
at 8p m tomorrow night .
yes , that's a good idea .
when can we expect you for dinner ? can you come tonight ?
well . how about friday then ?
good . shall we say seven o'clock ?
that'll be for you to decide . i've got a new dish that i want to try out on you .
come on , you must tell me everything about him .
hmm .
oh , how long ?
really ?
fine .
i know ! but it's really important to her ! her whole life could be ruined by this man !
can we sit on the grass , darling ?
look , darling ! i can see a bench near that tree .
it's not raining , darling . the bench isn't wet .
yes , i can .
hi melissa , are you going home this weekend ?
where do your parents live ?
how about your mother ?
oh , i am sorry to hear that . is your father still working ?
do you have any family here ?
do you see them a lot ?
i finally went out to dinner with him last night .
true , a sea food restaurant .
i didn't notice . i don't really even know what i ate .
how wonderful it is to be in love ! it's love at first sight ! oh . he's my romeo !
oh , mary . you've surprised me !
um — i was just thinking aloud .
come off it , mary .
you certainly do like teasing me , mary . well i'm in love with someone . the question is , how do i get his attention ?
he said he will get married by the end of this month .
i want to say .
that i can't go on any longer without you .
nancy , i made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight .
forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments .
i really love you .
and i hope so . this is what you were meant for . say you love me , say yes , say yes .
are you having a good time ?
as far as i know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . are you stressed at all ?
you're a good student . i'm sure you can do well . what you need to do is to relax .
taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress .
you need to take some breaks throughout the day . studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective .
besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . in fact , i can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! you just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply .
hello , tom !
how are you doing ?
i'm just a little tired .
i have a lot of work to do in the company recently .
pretty fine , thanks .
i am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . i must go now .
where did you end up going ?
i've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
sure . what's this one a picture of ?
you don't look very happy in that picture .
so what did you do ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
how is your business on the internet , steven ?
i am sorry to hear that . it shows that you should buy companies , not ideas .
yes , i agree with you . i am going to find a good company and invest in it soon .
yes , i will . i should learn more from you . after all i am green hand on it .
ok . my wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . i am leaving .
the man behind your mother must be your elder brother .
is this your brother in law ?
from his looks , i'd say he's a man of character .
lee , i'm going to get married next month .
what kind of sport do you often do ?
i used to swim a lot , but now i'm taking gym classes .
then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . he has much sympathy .
were you one of them ?
hello , kevin .
so nice to see you again , louise . how are you doing ?
hi ! my name is mike .
nice to meet you , too .
i'm from shanghai . and you ?
what are you doing there with your mobile phone ?
moblogging ? what does that mean ?
sounds interesting ! that must be very convenient .
how can you do that ?
what if you want to publish some photos ?
jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ?
well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
she's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me .
not at all . she's actually very athletic .
no , but she does wear contact lenses .
she's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
i think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot .
it's a butterfly everyone in her family has one .
yes , even her mother .
she's a lot like me .
don't you notice that bob has a mole on his face , but tom does not .
charles , have you finished your homework ?
i want you to have a walk with me .
your house is too small . why not buy a big one .
you can get a loan from the bank . you know lpf program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases .
do you know what e commerce is ?
that's right
today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet .
yes , i think so . my friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the internet .
that's true . i can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered .
hello , daisy , how are you doing ?
but it's really exciting .
basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
did you read the news that ' china's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in december , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ?
yes . it says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics .
this dish tastes terrific . would you like to try a little ? it is a little hot , but very good .
come on , it's the weekend . let's taste and enjoy this meal . cheers !
hi , jim . how are you ? i haven't seen you for a while .
what date is it today ?
look at the girls in the street . they all have a bunch of flowers . is it valentine's day ?
did you have a fight with jack ?
come on , dear ! you forgot it , too .
is that your phone ?
wow ! good timing .
come on ! three's a crowd !
well , i ’ d better get back to work . i ’ ve got a ton of stuff on my desk !
yeah , definitely . i was hoping to catch a ride with you .
thanks for the advice , mr . macmillan . i'll keep it in mind . i had better head off though . i ’ m meeting my husband for dinner .
thanks , sir . you too . drive safely , i hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads .
do you like olives ? or would you prefer crisps ?
do you like it ? it's irish music .
arm i think it was in the cd shop in the mall . have you been there ?
yes . hey , i've got some photos of our holiday in ireland . would you like to see them ?
graham , why are you always on the phone with jane ?
are you sure ?
okay , i'm sorry . i believe you .
because you are the most handsome boy at the university and i love you so much ! i guess i just go crazy sometimes . that's all .
why ?
how are you ?
i'm okay . what are you doing these days ?
that's great . when are you starting ?
oh , fine . hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ?
are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon ?
i'm sorry . i'm attending a meeting at the hilton then .
no . i'm busy then too . i'm meeting dorothy heath at north bridge road . are you free on thursday afternoon ?
good idea ! is two o'clock okay ?
terrible . how about people's lives ?
that's great . it seems that typhoon is not as bad as earthquake .
that's why many people died in the earthquake .
oh , china does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history .
we're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face wenchman earthquake .
what a pin up she is !
that's incredible ! she has such a sharp figure .
hi , jane . how are you doing this morning ?
late night ?
hey , what's the matter ?
are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ?
i don't think i'm getting better .
can i use your laptop for a while ?
oh , isn't your computer wi fi capable ?
oh my , no internet access is killing me .
no , i'm not feeling myself . i just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends .
what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me .
that's alright . i just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . it almost drives me crazy .
i'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
what do you plan to do for your birthday ?
we could find a classical one .
not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . i can't believe it !
yeah , that's right . if no one sends me text messages , i'll go crazy .
addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !
absolutely .
yeah , it's a must . otherwise , i may miss important phone calls and text messages .
yes . msn , qq , skype , google talk , ali wangwang , everything , so that i'll be in touch with all friends and relatives .
are you a blogger ?
oh , it seems that i'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ?
what do you usually write about ?
that's interesting . how often do you write a blog ?
got it . are you still updating your blog ?
how's life going , zhang lin ?
pretty good , thanks . i'm going to see my uncle .
but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other's company .
can't you hang out with them , too ?
i still think you two should try to patch things up .
how did you spend the weekend ?
really ? how was it ?
oh , yeah ? what's it about ?
sounds pretty good . is it a tragedy ?
oh , i like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . maybe i should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend .
did roll win the race ?
but anyway , he won at last .
ben cancelled his trip .
because general , his dog , got sick .
what do you want for your birthday from your parents ?
why don't you ask them to buy you a pc ? you will soon use it at college .
what is the matter with him ?
fine . how is jim ?
is this a photo of your family ?
you look so lovely .
i'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .
sure . if i could , i would eat hot pot every day !
well . ? have you thought of it yet ?
never mind . there's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the china world trade towers on chang an street . have you been there ?
how is your ankle ?
please be careful next time .
wang , i'd like you to meet my friend . dou , this is wang .
pleased meet you , too , mr . dou .
is she busy ?
i've got to go to bed . have to work tomorrow .
hello , my name is xu hua . i'm from beijing .
welcome to china , paula .
hello , i'm lance .
who's that old lady trimming the trees ?
she looks very healthy . how old is she ?
nice day , isn't it ?
song , i hate to say goodbye , but i have to .
abc rent a car . may i help you ?
we have volkswagen , pinto , plymouth and datsun .
twenty dollars per day for volkswagen , pinto and datsun , and twenty seven dollars for plymouth .
there is no charge for mileage . and fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included .
all right , sir . may i have your driver's license ?
they must be your parents , what do they do ?
do they often take you out ?
this is my uncle , charles .
he's a captain .
what a brilliant smile !
he must be very easy going .
your father looks much younger in the picture .
how old is he now ?
what shall i call him ?
what's he doing ?
i heard many stories about your brother .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
sorry to interrupt . can i have a word with you ?
after you .
hello , julia , i know a party that will begin at midnight . would you love to go ?
what a pity ! the party is very interesting .
don ’ t complain about it . she is concerned about your safety .
tomorrow's carl's birthday ?
steven , have you any friend in london ?
are you close ?
i'm going to london on business next week . but i know nothing about it .
yes , steven . you always know what i want .
let me hold the door for you , miss .
i want to invite you to go to the movies .
yes .
where do you want to meet ?
what time should we meet ?
mr . martin , we're on arrival .
we'll miss you . i hope we'll keep in touch .
it's my pleasure . we hope you'll visit beijing again .
i'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
the taj ? they're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .
shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
what a nice day ! why don't we go for an outing ?
how about going to the suburbs ?
mum , this is for you .
happy mother's day to you , mum !
happy new year , jim !
merry christmas , linda !
linda , thank you for this wonderful christmas dinner . i really enjoyed it .
hi , where have you been ?
oh , how was it ?
victoria , you are back from vacation ! how was it ?
good to see you . come on in .
you don't look too well . maybe you should take the day off from work .
do you feel ok ?
why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
zach , what's that on your arm ?
i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . let's go .
we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
which season do you like best ?
have you heard about michael's new home ? it's in one of the poshest areas in this area .
no , he's living in an old house in warton .
that's the one .
no one in the family expected to get a dime from him . it was quite a surprise .
he still has a complaint though .
he wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop .
what's the weather like in your hometown ?
is it hot in summer ?
let's invite bobbie and john to our party , ok ?
why ?
some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are .
i was fooled once . a lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . so i gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . but later i learned that she had lied to me .
sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a barbie doll .
maybe i am a barbie doll , but i won ’ t do barbie doll things .
no wonder people say
i'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . i need your understanding .
can ’ t you be more considerate ? i need your encouragement .
what a beautiful view .
yes , there is beautiful view . you can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .
please fill out the form .
i have a large family . i have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents .
we ’ re identical . i mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else .
we used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn ’ t mention to your biological father .
what about your step brother ’ s mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
have you ever thought about having children , kaitlyn ?
well , i ’ ve always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother , i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ?
don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ?
if china didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
how is everything going with your girlfriend ?
oh , i am sorry to hear that . i did ’ t know that you had split up . what happened ?
really ! did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ?
what was she thinking ? did you confront her about it when you saw her ?
i bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . you were such a good catch ! she really lost out , didn ’ t she ?
don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ?
what store do you shop at ?
i have been using the store across town for years .
they do , but they're a little expensive on certain items .
how was your holiday to cyprus ?
did you happen to meet someone ?
you always act like this when you ’ ve fallen in love . who is he ? how did you meet ?
was it love at first sight ?
and ?
that happened quickly ! are you going to see him again ?
it sounds like he is madly in love with you . are you ready for such a serious relationship ?
how are you doing , andrew ?
but you have so many friends ! how could you be lonely ?
what about me ? i ’ m your friend .
i know what you mean . i find it difficult to make new friends , too . it ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ?
i ’ ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends .
what kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ?
people who play ultimate frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate frisbee club .
what was your wedding ceremony like , abigail ?
three parties ? that's quite a lot . that must have been expensive !
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ?
you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
what do you think of the coming match ?
what are you doing now , steven ?
oh , my god . do you want to be a millionaire ? i can see you are very crazy about money .
no , you are wrong . money can't buy happiness and health . i won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . in other words , i don't want to be a millionaire and i want to have more free time to enjoy life .
maybe you are right . please take care of yourself when you make money . anyway health is the most important thing .
you like movies ?
what type do you like the best ?
i see . i generally like movies to help calm me down . i think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it .
have you thought of moving at all , sarah ?
buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses .
well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way .
sure , my sister in law and her husband just bought a house that way . they ’ re pretty satisfied with it .
not at all . the woman , who owned it , took good care of it . but when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her .
it was about 75 years old . there were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time .
the question is easy for everybody . don ' t you think so ?
why do you say so ?
have you ever seen bill gate's home on the internet ?
i think his house is fantastic , but i wouldn't want to live there . you would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . it's just too big of a place to take care of on your own .
my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in england .
old homes are great because they've got character . i think that's important .
this historian is famous in the field of tang dynasty .
right , to be famous to be respectable in some way .
i went out with leo last night . it was really exciting .
good morning , kevin .
hello , tom ! do you have plans for this evening ?
let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , ok ?
don ’ t worry . i will arrange everything .
you have a nice apartment .
she must have done a lot of work on it .
hello , tom . how do you find the dinner of yesterday ?
it's nice of you to say so .
don't mention it . you know , we ’ re old friends .
yes . why ?
hi , bob . can i have the book back i lent to you last month ?
could you lend your bike to me for several days ?
hi , zhengjun , what make you so happy .
how do you arrange this summer vacation ?
where would you like to go ?
yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it's really .
can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ?
it's friday .
jack , i hear you got promoted . is that true ?
oh , jack , you deserve it . you ' ve been working so hard .
hi ! tom . want to go to play bowling tonight ?
let me see . how about 6:30 at the gate of the club ?
now , you are to board the plane . we ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in china .
we are ready to help you .
i'd like to . i'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us . welcome to china again .
i don ’ t know what i ’ m going to do ! it ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if i lose my job !
it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions .
i have enough to live off of for about 3 months . but i really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! i ’ d rather invest my money somehow .
next month . so i can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .
what's your favorite sport ?
what are the good sights to see in beijing ?
what's the most popular sport in your country ?
do you play table tennis ?
do you know how to go to the fragrant hills in beijing ? i heard that they are very famous in china .
that must be very beautiful .
really ? have you ever been there ?
can you go there with me ? i'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me .
hello , hanson . today i come to say goodbye to you , for i'm going back to london tomorrow .
much as i wish to but i really can ’ t . i've already booked the flight .
of course not . you can come to london to visit me in future . and i also will come here if i have a chance .
i will miss you , too . you're really a good friend .
it doesn't matter .
i will .
what is your favorite pastime ?
is it ? mine is climbing mountains on sunday mornings .
what are your hobbies ?
like what ?
i slept like a baby . i fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares !
i feel much better , but i'm still worried about something .
for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because i'm pretty impatient . how can i prevent myself from getting stressed if i get stuck in a traffic jam ?
ok , i'll try that .
just one more thing . a school called me this morning to see if i could teach a few classes this weekend and i don't know what to do .
i'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on monday .
steven , have you ever met hanson ever since he went back to london ?
what's the way you keep in contact ?
email is not always the best form . i think qq is way better .
what do you do in your spare time ?
what kind of music do you like ?
i like small towns .
not always , and there're also few cars !
by the way , i'm robin .
nice to meet you .
i'm from kathmandu . what about you ?
the city has got a traffic problem .
you said it .

is it because of the bad weather ? it's been really miserable for the past tew days .
not really , but i've got used to it now .

i haven't met the smiths for a long time .
why ?
judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ?
what ? that's too much .
ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget .
hmm , what i'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel .
are you going anywhere for your vacation ?
that'll be lovely . where are you going ?
well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then .
it sounds good . you can do a lot of sightseeing , too .
so , you're going to have a really nice vacation .
a new film is on . have you ever seen it ?
the acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .
what do you know about julia roberts ?
i mean her personality .
i'll always remember my college days .
it was one of the best times in my life . it was tough , but i made it . i became a college graduate .
it was a round day for me . my family attend the graduation ceremony . i was so nervous . i couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end .
i was planning to attend gradate school , but then i was offered a good job doing marketing , so i changed my mind .
how could it be ?
you didn't have an offer ?
how do you like other films starring charlie chaplin ?
whose part do you think is best played ?
you're absolutely right ! that's the very figure i like best .
excuse me . could you please take a picture of us with this camera ?
this one .
no , this is a focus free camera . all you have to do is point and press the button .
that was a nice funeral .
the son gave a nice speech about his father .

i don't know , maybe one hundred .
i think about twenty five .
i feel sorry for you .
what's your email address ?
bulldog 123 . are you sure that's all ?
no . that's incomplete .

that's correct .
bulldog 123 is just the street . you have to give me the city , state , and zip code .

i agree .
you can yell at them .
yelling doesn't do any good .

i can't believe how hot it is .
turn on the air conditioner .
when is he coming ?
hi , nicole . did you have a good weekend ?
and i bet you studied , too .
well , i didn't clean the house and i didn't study . i stayed in bed and watched tv .
where do you work , andrea ?
oh , really ? what do you do there ?
that sounds interesting !
i'm a student , and i have a part time job , too .
well , yes , i do . i'm a real fan of wanton marsalis .
no , he doesn't ! ! ! he plays the trumpet . so , what kind of music do you like ?
who's your favorite group ?
hello , chandler ! how are you ?
just so so . i am too tired . my company has been holding too many training sessions lately .
good ? ! for them but not to me .
we have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . you know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . and during the weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner .
yes , i agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ?
tell me about your brother and sister , sue .
really ? does she live here in seattle ?
wow ! ! and what does your brother do ?
i have tickets to the phantom of the opera on friday night . would you like to go ?
it's at 8: 00 .
uh , i'd like to , but i have to work late .
diana , in your opinion , which is more important , iq or eq ?
but iq is decided at birth . one can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it .
that ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . he must rely on his eq to deal with them .
i think it is independent of iq and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives .
just as forrest ?
look at this headline , soo mi .
is it the same in korea ?
do people get married young ?
hmm . do women usually work after they get married ?
people are funny .
did you hear about the pilot ?
yes , he stole a plane in canada and flew into the u . s .
yes . after two u . s . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway .
his life sucked . he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down .
the police need our help finding a robber .
yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old .
they didn't say .
of course not . that would be racist .
don't ask me .
how about you , chuck ? where did you grow up ?
oh . what was your major ?
that's interesting . so why did you become a hairdresser ?
say , anna , what are you doing tonight ? would you like to go out ?
well , how about tomorrow night ? are you doing anything then ?
i'm going to see a musical . would you like to come ?
i'm so excited ! we have two weeks off ! what are you going to do ?
well , my parents have rented a condominium in florida . i'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming .
say , why don't you come with us ? we have plenty of room .
hi , stephanie . i hear you have a new job .
so how do you like it ?
pretty good . say , you've really changed !
well , you look great ! how are you ?
hi , celia ! how was your trip to the united states ?
great . how long were you away ?
that's a long time ! was the weather ok ?
so , what was the best thing about your trip ?
mary , it's good to see you !
i am so glad that you decided to stop by !
mary , can i get josh or you something to drink ?
how about a little snack then ?
well then , how is your family ?
do you want to go to the beach tonight ?
i wanted to go to malibu beach .
the water there looks so dirty .
if that's okay with you .
hi julie , how are things going ?
i'm doing really well .
i bet that lee wasn't too happy with that !
he always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans .
how are you feeling , john ?
do more exercises after you are healthy .
are you hungry ? do you want me to buy something for you to eat ?
happy birthday ! this is for you , kate .
you know in china we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .
hello . i'm jason .
nice to meet you , dolma .
maybe we all will be all things to all men .
but for the life , we'll be changed by this society .
don't be silly . we have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves .
excuse me , i'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
my wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
thank you . also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . can you recommend some local attractions ?
i have a 10 year old boy and a 6 year old girl .
excuse me . i don't think we have met before . my name is mary jenson .
good to meet you , mr chettri .
we should keep frank at arm's length .
he hits below the belt .
now i know why i split up with mike . we found we were simply not good for each other .
what's strange about that ! as a person born under the sign of cancer , i am home loving and wish for a peaceful family life . but according to astrology , sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk taking . they seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life .
but in my case , the fact matches the theory . mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . it frightens me !
hello , alice . would you like to go to the temple fair with me ?
yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now .
absolutely , i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common .
what about tianqiao temple fair ? a variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you .
of course .
what had make you so upset ?
what ’ s wrong with that ?
i hear that you are in love with mike .
don't you hit it off ?
what a beautiful view , my sweetheart !
what is that below ?
no , thank you . it looks a bit too dangerous for me .
how is tom now ?
i met mark yesterday . he looked blue .
it belongs to the past . he lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now .
i feel that bob ’ s father in law is a hard nut to crack .
what did you say ?
i would back him up to the hilt anyway .
he's my brother .
how is grandpa doing recently ?
maybe i would talk with him someday .
the poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day .
look , it's all water over the dam now . let's leave it behind us .
our eyes should look into the future . we could not live in the past .
it's said that john's broken up .
i hear that john's leading a double wife .
i don't know how to deal with jack . he is indeed a trouble maker . he has loused up my business several times .
yeah .
bob is really disturbed these days .
but we cannot talk like elders .
i was told my friend joe was speaking ill of me . that's a real let down .
if he promised to help you , i'm sure he will help . he's a man of his word .
don't have some relation with him . you know , he is not a kind man .
if you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a roland for an oliver .
why are you going out with andy ?
it is high time you have a talk with him . that may help clear the mists .
if i were you , i would put the whole matter on the table .
really ? i'm not much of an outdoor person . what do you like about it ?
do you hike or fish on your trips ?
did you catch anything ?
jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . j
how do you like tom ?
are you ready to welcome him ?
really ? that's too bad ! you should be at home in bed . it's really important to get a lot of rest .
and have you taken anything for it ?
well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . then drink a cup every half hour . it really works !
don't be too sad . if you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem .
it seems to me that you fall for good looking guys .
you must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun .
do you know who that tall man is ?
why ?
did he see the doctor ?
that's a crying shame . it really is !
do you believe in horoscope fortune telling ?
that sounds interesting . have you been involved in any mystery ?
what did it say about you then ?
but it must have been only a coincidence . that's the only way superstition wins over science .
are you going to the party on saturday ?
everyone from school .
so am i going to see you at the party ?
hey , robert , what are you doing this weekend ?
we are putting together a birthday party for mary .
we thought it would be fun to have a pool party at jay's house .
we will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes .
dress casually and bring your bathing suit !
what are you doing this weekend ?
i was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach .
would you be interested in joining me ?
i thought that we could leave around 8
mr . lee , i was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next friday night ?
i've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home .
actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit down dinner for the holidays .
joe , how are you doing ?
i am free that night , and a party sounds good .
i kind of know where you live , but could you e mail me your address ?
i would really like to bring my friend jake , if that would be ok .
would you like some help with the food ?
it's raining outside , catherine , it's too bad . what ' s the weather like in your hometown ?
do you like the weather in seattle ?
why ?
what about the weather in boston ?
is it very cold in winter ?
welcome , ron , come on in !
we enjoy it too !
about four years now .
ron , have a seat and i'll get us something to drink .
i have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice .
hi , i haven't seen you in a while .
how long has it been since we last saw each other ?
what have you been doing for the past two years ?
what are you majoring in ?
you should easily be able to find a job with that major .
hi , linda . i haven't seen you for ages .
so do i .
i'm so glad to meet you .
fine .
it's nice and bright today , isn't it ?
how about winter ?
it's boring , right ?
do you get much rain during the summer ?
so you should bring an umbrella often .
it's a lovely day , isn't it ?
i love it when the weather is like this . why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ?
i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado ; but i must admit , this sure is a nice spring day .
okay . hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ?
i'm very well , thank you . how are you ?
yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
not bad thanks .
which season do you like best ?
why ?
what happened ?
let's stop and have a look .
i'm curious about that .
which season do you like best ?
how about summer ?
why ?
look at the cloud .
it's . oh it's the 1st april , april fool's day .
when were you born may i ask ?
by the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ?
i am afraid i can't be there on time .
well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?
tell me about it , will you ?
you were lucky then . what did you do after that ?
so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ?
i'm thirsty . pull over to that store , i'll buy some drinks .
oh , that's too bad , where can you park around here ?
is a shop there ?
do you often surf the internet ?
is it very interesting ?
no , i've not heard of it . tell me about it .
is it just a bus ?
hello , jason , there is going to be a screening of final destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . i plan to go to see it .
yeah , i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
that's funny , i didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?
that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
really ? i haven't heard of it .
i don't know why mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . i smell some rat in it .
nonsense ! there's no indication that he's in love with me .
how can you keep in touch with your aunt in america ?
why not send e mail through the internet ?
no problem . i'll tell you .
there is something wrong with my girlfriend .
the department manager is all over her . he says he loves her .
of course not ! she thinks he's an apple head . she doesn't like an apple headed man , you know .
jane , pleases come with us .
just for fun , not for showing . what do you worry about ?
it sounds that you have a high opinion of him .
birds of feather flock together .
you cannot judge a person that way . i have a hunch that he is a sly dog .
i told you that she is no fool .
she cannot get in dutch with him . he is her boss , you know .
how old are you ?
i'm older than you ! i'll be ten on april 14th .
happy birthday ! this is for you , kate !
you know in china we usually don't open presents until the guests leave .
who's singing in your home , jim ?
who's ellie ?
oh , i see . how old is she ?
i suppose they're playing games .
today .
yes .
eighteen . some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight . do you want to come ?
about 6:00 .
my wife is really a chatter box . it ’ s so boring .
what is it ?
hello mei , how about going for a meal this evening ?
ok that sounds good . where shall i meet you ?
ok great , i ’ ll see you at six .
don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?
don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?
are you alright , child ?
what did the nurse say ?
in that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest .
can you speak japanese ?
where did you learn it ?
how long have you been learning it ?
hi mary , how's it going ?
terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends .
really ? what happened ?
you know she probably feels just as bad .
well , in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want .
are we going to have gym class tomorrow ?
sometimes i forget that we don't have school on saturdays .
i'm going to study .
have you seen that house ?
you're right . i love it very much .
she must be deaf .
okay .
my pronunciation is not very good . it's l i n , lin .
did you hear that mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ?
a week ago ? they met last summer and now just sink . they will be married soon .
mary , pam and i are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes . do you want to come ?
pam and i are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us .
sink ?
mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation .
frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?
yes , he is . he loves the girl very much .
a girl he met on holiday in spain , i think .
lisa , i'm home .
pretty good . i've made a few friends already .
well , pam franklin lives next door to us . by the way , can i go to her house this saturday ?
that's what pam said .
mary , why don't you come to my house this saturday ?
of course .
it's 555 4321 .
how many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
hi wei , what are you going to do this weekend ?
oh right . how about sunday ?
oh really ? i ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok .
when ’ re you getting married ?
why so late ? didn ’ t she want to get married this october ?
that ’ s really a shame . by the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?
i like pop music very much .
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old fashioned ?
what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ?
what's there after that ?
what are they all for ?
i don't know how john can put up with his son , who fools around without working .
they promised us a sea view .
isn't it awful ? i can't bear to look at it . i don't think i can stand this place for two weeks .
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower .
you must have had a great time .
yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . sometimes new food might disagree with you .
that is great . everyone says french food is wonderful .
what university would you enter ?
oh , i forget . sorry .
did you ? and what course did you take there ?
i've not known . perhaps , i've got a bad memory .
you're from new york , aren't you ?
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
no , i don't like museums . they ' re boring .
you're not looking happy . what ' s the matter ?
with the job ?
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
what do you mean ?
you need a holiday . that ' s what's the matter .
hello , pam .
it looks like there are a lot of people inside .
should i take my shoes off ?
where are your parents ?
what about a factory tour ?
yes . i heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . we can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .
i'm not sure , but as far as i know , most factory tours are free . they are sponsored by the company providing the tour .
i believe most of them think it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better known .
exactly .
this is alex . remember ? this is sean .
over there are stacy and rebecca . we're all on the school's tennis team .
that's my boyfriend matt . isn't he cute ?
it's a lovely day , isn't it ?
is she american ?
sounds like you've got some competition . you made a move already ?
that's nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?
peter really is a remarkable expert ! there is very little he doesn ’ t know .
hi , larry , how was your weekend ?
great . i hung out with jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together .
yeah , i never thought we could be good friends either . we have our differences . she's more outgoing and active while i am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . we can talk for hours about anything .
when jo and i are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . besides , i know she will always be there for me when i need her , and she knows i'll be there for her .
exactly . having jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .
hey , mary , what's up ?
oh , that's exciting . what's this guy like ? is he hot ?
well , that's something i've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty .
good news !
the state of economy is starting to go up in our country .
i've heard you're going to america tomorrow . i want to see you off at the airport .
what time are you leaving ?
what airline and what flight ?
i'll see you at the airport at 12:30 p . m .
i cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother .
because he is often in trouble .
hi , michael , how's it going ?
i heard you got a new roommate . what's he like ?
oh ? what's wrong with his girlfriend ?
well , i guess it might take some time to get used to .
rough . maybe you can do the most of the talking .
i often recalled the days when tom and i were madly in love .
yeah . he always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
yeah , that's her . we had a lot of wonderful times together . she is really a special friend , and i want to get her something meaningful .
i don't think so . that way it would lose all the charm . i want it to be a surprise . i want to show her that i care about her and i hope our friendship will last .
hmm , i think i've got an idea . maybe i can get her an ever green plant to take back home .
i hope so . i'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . i hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .
do you feel better ?
it is too bad today .
my som was lost . i told him to stand rooted to the spot when i went shopping , but he ignored it .
it was the police wo helped me to do that .
did you get the car you wanted ?
what about the car over there ?
today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding .
yeah . they promised to stick together forever when they were young .
tim ’ s smiles are interesting .
you are right . they sweep nancy off her feet . and now she fell head over heels in love with him .
what's this , i wonder ?
a coffee grinder ?
what do you think of smoking ?
what in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ?
but that ’ ll affect the national economy .
do you think the weather will be good this weekend ?
oh . that ’ s a pity . i thought that we might go hiking in the hills .
excuse me . is anyone sitting here ?
you don ’ t mind if i smoke , do you ?
oh , i ’ m sorry . but this isn ’ t a no smoker , is it ? i mean would you mind if i smoke here ?
sign ? what ’ s sign ?
are you a smoker ?
are you feeling better today , bill ?
you ’ d better give up smoking . it ’ s bad for your health .
but you should make up your mind first .
why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? you ’ ll have the same time for work .
did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? the person who wrote that must be crazy .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
hey , where's cindy ?
you're mary , right ?
cindy told me about you in our gym class .
my house is next door to yours .
i'm afraid i've had a terrible row with my boss . what shall i do ?
oh , but i can't . it wasn't my fault .
i don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him .
well , everything is packed and ready to go .
yes . just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth watering food , centuries old castles
yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals .
of course . that was the best pasta i've ever had .
oh , my god ! only two hours left before the plane takes off . we need to be at the airport now .
you'd better give up smoking . it's bad for your health .
but you should make up your mind first .
why don't you go to bed and get up early ? you'll have the same time for work .
hi , i'm lucas , i just moved in next door .
nice to meet you too .
thanks . some tea would be nice . chinese tea is great . i really like your tea set . where did you get it ?
oh yeah , i saw the tea house the other day . i think i might go and have a look sometime . it's a nice neighborhood here .
there's a gym nearby ? that's exciting ! i really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . i've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .
it's very kind of you to come and see us off .
we would stay longer . but i've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . thank you for your warm hospitality .
my wife and i will look forward to it .
lt's flight no . 302 , northwest orient airlines .
then we've got to get going .
thank you again for all your help .
now darling , i know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . i think we should sell it .
but we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . i think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
well , only you liked it really , darling .
i feel very miserable . i took the death of my wife very hard , you know .
i ’ ve tried it , not a chance .
do you like traveling , kathy ?
or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving .
guess who i saw just now ?
john smith , the escaped criminal .
i think i must report to the cops .
cindy , i have this room to myself ?
it's twice as big as my room in taiwan !
i think i'm going to like it here .
matthew ? hi !
i'm pretty good . i've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i don't want to renew it .
not yet . but i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck .
mrs . thou ?
great . it's a lovely neighborhood . and it would be nice to be neighbors again . it would be just like the old days !
don ’ t worry . they are grown ups .
what happened to nancy ? she is all sweetness and light today .
no wonder ! who is the bridegroom ?
how is jim recently ?
how is rose now ?
what is wrong with peter ? he sure looks unhappy .
how foolish he is . the girl is inviting . she often makes a pass at boys .
john's very late . do you think he's coming ?
what a police officer !
lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married .
not necessarily . this is only what she says , not what she does .
i'm going to try sky diving this weekend .
i want to try something exciting .
i'll tell you all about it next monday .
i couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them .
you carried it too far . you obviously offended someone .
so alex , you ’ re off to the olympic stadium then ?
wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there .
well have a good time . get me some autographs if you can .
every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them .
what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
that's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
i haven't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ?
oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ?
any other ideas ?
how ’ s your trip going ?
isn ’ t london hot in the summer ?
i see . what about transport ? how does shanghai compare to london ?
and what about the number of people on the streets ?
cindy , how come nearly all the prime time tv shows are comedies ?
sitcoms ?
in taiwan , prime time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
have you been to shanghai before ?
that sounds great . have you been to the top of the pearl tower ?
hello martin . have you been to any events yet ?
oh wow . how was it ?
oh i still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . i ’ d love to see something though .
what happened to you yesterday ?
oh i see . so that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ?
oh dear , that sounds terrible .
oh that ’ s a lovely necklace .
oh i didn ’ t know you were married .
oh i see . that ’ s nice . did you meet your husband at work ?
oh you look awful ! what ’ s the matter ?
oh dear . maybe you ’ ve caught a cold .
well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking .
how did you meet your boyfriend , cindy ?
who made the first move ?
wow !
is jack still staying idle everyday ?
really ? he is so competent now .
mandy , would you like to come for dinner tonight ?
at the new five spices restaurant in chaoyang .
it ’ s asian fusion . i heard it ’ s delicious .
brad bush ? good for you !
you mean you've never had a boyfriend ?
until college ?
i heard that you're going on your first date friday night .
angry ? why would i be ?
come on . dating is a part of young people's social life . besides , you're sixteen already .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
oh , i don't think you're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
you're right . i love going out and making new friends .
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?
what are they ?
why ?
that makes sense . probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .
what's that ?
wow ! no wonder people are so fat . say , carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
i think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring hugh grant . let ’ s go and see that .
well how about meeting at my place ?
do you think the taxi driver will understand you ?
ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ?
what's your favorite book ?
why do you like it best ?
well . i like the thorn birds best .
sure . i like the writer's language , too .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
what's that book you have under your arm ?
how in the world did you get a copy ? i've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i'm still waiting my turn .
is it really worth paying for ?
i am exhausted . i need some sleep .
i twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . i was worried about my mother ’ s health .
mr . ben , what do you think of the book ?
why ?
where are you going this weekend ?
oh really ? it ’ ll be nice and warm there . have you been there before ?
i see . what ’ s it like there ?
i like football best of all .
it's a very good game .
my son closed his ear to what i said . i don ’ t know what i should do .
every country should face the history .
sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first .
i ’ m pretty sure that jim will turn out to be a good lawyer .
did you have a good weekend ?
oh i see . so what did you do then ?
ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ?
how was mei ’ s party on saturday ?
oh really ? what did you do ?
i see . anything else ?
what ’ s the life expectancy in your country ?
about 70 , i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
how ’ s your son these days ?
he ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
yes , i think you ’ re right . i ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .
yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how long have you been in england ?
almost two years ? your english is very good .
lovely day , isn't it ?
you are not english , are you ?
i don't think we've met .
mr . smith often talked about you .
can you tell me a little about paris ?
i want to see some of the famous places like eiffel tower , the seine river .
that's a good idea . i almost forget it . what else ?
oh , wonderful ! how is the weather ?
so you ’ re free on saturday night ?
would you like to have dinner with me ?
have you ever been to britain ?
really ? how often do you go there ?
do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ?
what a good day !
right . let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery .
wow , what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery .
i feel as if i'm living in a different world , honey .
i think we should go out more frequently . the natural scenery can do us good .
are you free this evening , li ?
what a pity . i wanted to go for a drink with you .
so john , have you ever been to china before ?
have you travelled to many other countries ?
what about america ? have you ever been to the united states ?
hi colin . how are you feeling today ?
it's probably jet lag .
do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ?
hi amy , you look very happy .
wow . you must be very excited .
shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ?
me too . i feel very thirsty as well .
susan , good evening . why are you so dressed up ?
you look great . your make up is perfect .
no , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that .
with that dress i'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect .
yeah , most of the people are from our office .
tomorrow i'll take you to some places that i'm sure you will have interest in .
they are the folk antique handicrafts and collectibles exhibition halls .
no hurry ! i'ii tell you now , the collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini musical instruments , root carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars .
the dinner was really good . it knocked my socks off .
great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal .
port , please .
next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine .
it's made from naturally frozen grapes .
ok , here's to your health .
you look happy .
wow ! is it a good car ?
was it expensive ?
what colour is it ?
the bartender just gave the last call . let's order another round , okay ?
that sounds good . you order the beer while i go to the bathroom . where is the can in this place ?
yeah . i think i can find it .
that's because i just took one step inside and turned right around . that bathroom is too gross for me .
let's leave then . i could take some fresh air , anyway .
what's beijing like ?
what can i see in beijing ?
wei , you look really tired .
why ’ s that ?
what does your sister look like , mike ?
is she like you ?
is she as clever as you ?
jenny , i want to go on a picnic . could you come too ?
then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
sure . bring enough films , please .
so , you also like coffee ?
but i also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction
well , i adjust going to have to disagree with you . a healthy body wakes up without caffeine !
you may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel .
haven't seen you for a long time
i bet you had a wonderful time
when is your vacation going to start ?
oh , that's only a few days from now ! how many weeks are you going to be taking ?
where are you going now .
have you made your hotel reservation yet ?
you're lucky . it's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in august
i'm going on a guided tour in the mountain .
i like the sight and the sound . it worked on me like a magic when i was a child
when did you arrive here ?
really ? how long will your holiday last ?
all these countries in two weeks ?
we're lucky today .
where's hyde park ?
that's the place where people make speeches on sundays , isn't it ?
well , are we going there today ? i want to take shots there .
when is your birthday ?
do you usually have a birthday party ?
what would you do at the party ?
do you know when people began to sing the song happy birthday ?
let me tell you the story . in 1892 , patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called ' good morning to you ' . but later someone added the words ' happy birthday ' to their tune .
tonight is a party night ! what drinks do you think we need ?
i don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , two super bottles of cola should cover everyone . what about wine ?
no , once i fill the tub with beer , i'll get the ice . the beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . the cooler , the better .
look ! there's a folk concert tomorrow evening . do you want to go ?
not very much . classical music sends me to sleep
it ’ s true .
oh , boy , i hate to say this , but i really have to leave now .
i ’ m so sorry .
the great wall is a great attraction for visitors .
someone claimed it was one of the two man made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
how are you tonight , sir ?
i know what you mean . what can i get for you ?
one screwdriver , coming right up . ( he mixes the drink . ) here you are , sir .
jenny , i want to go on a picnic . could you come too ?
then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages .
sure . bring enough films , please .
good evening . i've come to see miss morrison
oh ! i've just come back from canada and i've brought a parcel from her parents
but you're busy , aren't you ?
i can leave the parcel with you , can't i ?
so you don't travel a lot now ?
it's certainly a popular hobby . i know a lot of people love stamps .
i believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ?
well , every stamp has a story to tell .
good .
there's a lot to share when you have a common interest .
my sister was taken to the hospital yesterday
she was hit by a car . luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt .
we'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon
oh , that's really tough .
i can understand . by the way , is there anyway i can help ?
oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , i'll always be there .
how have you been ?
and how ’ s everyone in your family ?
jack and mary broke up .
mary said jack was cheating on her . jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . one day , may saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .
how so ?
poor mary ! she really liked him .
do you think they ’ ll get back together ?
i hope she ’ ll recover soon .
how's it going ?
to be honest , i'm a bit fed up .
there's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
sure , but how ?
but for what reasons ? she doesn't even know who i am .
easier said than done .
but i always get tongue tied when i see her .
i see . i'll try .
i hear that some guys splash all their money about on them .
hello ?
nothing . just watching tv .
sure . what time ?
hi , mary . i haven't seen you in ages ! i heard that you and daniel are getting married on august 8th , the opening day of the 2008 olympic games . is it true ?
is everything ready now ?
have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
it's an excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
i guess you're right . i can help you ask other hotels . i am sure there are probably some available .
this is tough to say , jordan , but i think we should break up .
yes , i mean it .
no , we are just too different . this isn ’ t working .
i ’ m sorry .
then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?
i don't want to argue with you anymore . this is going to be tough , but let ’ s try and be friends .
i think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart .
hello ?
why not ?
what ’ s your new job like ?
um .
very nice .
what happened , john ?
why do you look unhappy ?
oh , cheer up . he ’ ll understand you .
why not go to see the doctor ?
our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . i ’ ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off .
then what shall we do ?
take good care of yourself .
hello ?
i ’ ve no idea . nothing really .
wonderful .
have you ever thought about tom ’ s attitude ?
love me , love my dog . he ’ s a sensible kind man .
i cannot ignore her suggestion . in fact i always value her suggestion .
well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage .
mary seems depressed . what ’ s the matter ?
okay , can i ask you something direct ?
fair enough . give it to me straight . did she bully you into this ?
i tell ya , when i got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . you've done a complete 180 .
it seems that something is praying heavy on you . what ’ s the matter ?
what did you do to get his goat ?
henry , don ’ t get out of doing housework .
you mean that is my business .
i ’ m your wife , not a housewife . i have my own work .
i learned of the railway accident only this morning .
the woman was beaten again . why didn ’ t she call the police .
it is incredible .
to be a revolutionary needs great courage !
galileo is one of them .
you seem depressed these days . what's the matter ?
if i can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know .
does tom drink a lot ?
you seem to very busy these days . what are you doing ?
where did you spend your holiday ?
what did the boss say to you ?
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what ’ s the matter .
my son is alway complaining that i dump on him . he was very rude and told me to mind my own business . i cannot put up with that .
you are blue in the face , arn't you ?
but supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ?
what did he say ?
it ’ s too good to be true ! if i were there , i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
you married joe , didn't you ?
it is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas .
where is tom ?
what ? it ’ s only 9p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
i think that ’ s settled .
how dare you speak to me like this .
it isn't your fault . no one will blame you .
i feel pity for the old man .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
where is john ? i can't find him anywhere .
what ? beg your pardon .
you seem to like her very much , don't you ?
but i heard that she had a three year old girl .
what will you do now ? propose to her .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
you know that ? dan got a divorce .
yeah . but his relation with sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
may doesn't get along very well with her mother in law .
poor john ! he is bettering bother sides of this bread .
when i quarrel with my husband . he didn't even try to cool me out .
it's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy .
i am not certain about that .
your husband is very helpful , isn't he ?
really ?
they got a divorce at last .
you said it . love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
why are you so rude to your wife ?
but she means to help you , not to trouble you .
what will happen to the children if you break up ?
a friend of mine is now in the big house . he was caught red handed for selling cocaine .
he must be regretting about having done the business .
hurry up ! time is money !
but you are too slow to follow them .
i don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit .
if i were li na , i would ask her if she had done that .
hi , what ’ re you reading ?
no , not that one . but i saw the movie . could i borrow it when you finished .
mary , how was your date with john ?
oh , really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
oh , it's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ?
come on , mary , you're a total catch . i bet he will call you . don't worry .
you know , mary , i feel we meet somewhere before . where were you born ?
what was your childhood like ?
where did you go to university ?
did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ?
how was the movie last night ?
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
she liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
the band is pretty good . how do you like the music ?
well , then , may i invite you for the next dance ?
you dance beautifully too .
in college . but i don't dance very often . what's your favourite dance ?
how about tango ?
tango is my favorite . anything but hip hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped )
i wonder what he looks like . oh , i can't wait to see him ! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me .
hey , lily , what are you doing ?
you mean the boy you met on msn ?
you must be joking . you can't fall in love with someone you've never met !
i think it's just a crush . you can't be serious .
did you tell him ?
we ’ re going to the movies . will you join us ?
why not ?
then would you like to have lunch with us ?
would you like me to give you a lift ?
come on . it ’ s no trouble at all .
what's the problem , nada ? you look down in the dumps .
come on , nothing can be that bad .
ok , i promise . so what's troubling you so much ?
then what's your problem ?
john seems to be in high cotton . he may well become a big shot .
what is your idea ?
he must be mad ! nick is a loan shark .
what would you reckon the taxing increases ?
but what do most people think about it ?
jimmy , i ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . what do you think of it ?
what ? but it is my favorite piece of clothing .
what am i going to do ?
i wonder how sarah and mat are .
i'm not surprised . she's a plain jane .

susan has got the cancer of stomach .
yesterday when i went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when i saw her .
ben always appears rude to the people around him .
because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
i heard that ann had divorced .
poor ann . she did not love her husband at all .
susan is going to get a divorce .
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
i understand your feeling . when someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . this is what we call the milk of human kindness .
all the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth .
john dates her seven times a week .
i think so . maybe he's fallen for her .
would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ?
good afternoon , johnson .
every year , the south has the floods . it is an act of god .
yeah , you have some other ideas ?
for example ?

he has a girlfriend already .
his new girlfriend is a far cry from ann . she is like a breath of fresh air .
jack wonders whether linda likes him or not .
he is too scared to ask her .
i fell down and hurt my arm .
then my son drove into a tree .
the dog bit the delivery boy .
i am not convinced by your explanation . could you explain it ?
i can't accept your excuse . it's five o'clock .
is this seat taken ?
thanks .
yes , on a business trip . how about yuu ?
yes , i went there once last summer .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i didn't enjoy was the subway .
yes . these were always so many people . after taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans .
that's a good idea . wish you a great vacation !
sandra is actually a blue chipper . i don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women .
i feel sorry for her .

excuse me for taking your time .
um , which of them is the better typist ?
is there any difference in their short hand ?
how about languages ?
what ? how could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ?
how could you ? i reminded you just this morning .
is there anything wrong ?
don ’ t worry . that ’ s just a part of being a teenager .
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
bob refused all his classmates ' invitations .
he is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him .
does your wife work ?
oh , i understand . she cooks , cleans and takes care of children . is that right ?
i ’ m so excited , mother . oh , a new baby !
and my first nephew . he looks a lot like you , mum . he does .
it ’ s true . michelle is a lot like henry in so many ways . and she is shy with new people just like he is .
all right . but these are black and i don ’ t like black shoes . they ’ re dull .
then why are you wearing black shoes ?
i ’ m sorry , dad . but you can ’ t do that . it ’ s for me to decide .
i didn ’ t say i ’ d already decided , dad . i said it was for me to decide . there is a difference .
did you go to the movie yesterday ?
what did you think of it ?
i think it is the worst one i have ever seen .
i can't think the same .
doesn't she have any friends ?
i think modern painting means nothing .
then why are so many guys so crazy about it ?
have you heard about alice and david ?
no , they've got engaged .
well , my dear , i didn't believe it either . but i got it straight from the horse's mouth . david called me this morning .
next june .
you have to . it is sure .
dalian is a beautiful city . do you agree ?
this city is really comfortable to live in .
no other city can match it . it's heaven .
maybe .
you say he was around average height .
weight ?
any marks on his face ?
glasses ?
what about his hair ?
what do you think of doctor thompson ?
how can you be so sure ?
do you think they two will get married ?
i think so . yes , they get along so well .
congratulations on your success .
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a chinese ?
not yet . but i wonder if i can get my parents ’ consent .
you are right . it is giving me a real headache . i feel like i ’ m between a rock and a hard place .
oh , how did you deal with it ?
oh , it ’ s a pity . what was the matter ?
like what ?
oh , i see . in their culture women should put family first .
so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
you know you didn't .
yes , but you might have told me before .
you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
my old man always harps on me .
but i can't bear it , john .
who did the stupid thing ?
i don't think so . dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that .
i love slim girls , don ’ t you ?
and i like a girl with good skin , do you ?
well , yes . but surely you like a girl with a nice figure .
nice to see you , patrick .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
hi , natasha , how's life ?
oh , you must be very happy . how many people are there in your family ?
i have a small family . they are my parents , my younger brother and me .
yes , it did . but my parents are ethnic minority people . it's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .
the child must feel very longly . my younger brother is 10 years younger than me . before he was born , i used to be the only child and always dreamed that i would have a younger sister or brother one day .
yes , we are very close . he is 12 years old now and very smart . he always makes us laugh a lot .
would you like to come out with me tonight ?
tomorrow night , then ?
i was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then .
ok . how about give me a ring , then ?
why not ?
jenny , are you having fun here ?
i ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it .
you ’ re all set now ?
i was happy to help .
don ’ t mention it .
when can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? next saturday ?
how about sunday then ?
would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
i ’ ll pick you up at . say , 7 , 30 ?
see you tonight then .
diana , do you like the perfume i gave you ?
i ’ m sorry . i didn ’ t know that .
excuse me . may i take a picture of you and your little boy ?
it ’ s for a book .
are you doing anything tonight ?
do you like western music ?
there ’ s a concert tonight . would you like to go and listen to it ?
i decided to go for this kind of life .
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
same here . have you seen any new films recently ?
oh . really ? i saw it two years ago . it's worth seeing and it's thought provoking .
it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever changing world .
well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too .
oh , that's too short lived .
in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .
hello , deva , how are you ?
not bad . have you heard wendy divorced her husband ?
yes . they used to be joined at the hip .
yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things .
you said it . you know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .
yeah . we chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .
we've heard so much about chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .
i haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him .
i'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , i don't know who is well in the know .
do you love me ?
yes , but do you love me ?
why didn ’ t you answer my question ?
don ’ t cherish your words , dear .
what's your opinion about childless couples ? will you choose to have no kids ?
why ? do you have to make a choice now ?
what's the puzzle ?
oh , i see . i think the older generation tend to think in a different way .
oh , really ? maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .
definitely .
we are going to the concert this evening . will you join us ?
do you know sally ?
why is she still single ? she must have a face that would stop a clock .
i am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up .
you know john ?
i wish he could too .
you ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ?
if you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me .
he was once a poor man but now he is a man of means .
i didn't expect to see you at this hour . you must have goofed off again .
you'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . he may probably give you the bag .
i didn't expect to see you at this hour . you must have goofed off again .
why did tom quit his job ?
what a great weekend that was !
i really enjoy the beach in the summer .
we should come here more often .
whatever we do , we should do it above board .
what do you think of the new television channel ? aren't the programs awful ?
actually , what bothers me is the violence . there are far too many detective and police shows .
the baby is crying again .
how can you do so ? perhaps something is wrong with him . let ’ s go and see him .
mary , i have something to tell you .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . but i think i must tell you .
i had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .
i ’ m not sure . i ’ ll try to prove my feeling .
he said i have a big nose . i wonder what that means .
does he mean i am inquisitive or i ’ m noisy ?
i ’ m fed up with marriage .
oh , no . when we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . it was a hard time .
and we have some squabbles on some boring things .
he would have recovered from the stress and got married again .
you are starting to learn english ?
you ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . i learned english very late , and learned it all by myself . at that time we didn ’ t have a good english studying environment . i have to keep my dictionary on hand .
the flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain .
this one looks great ! i love the seashore .
yeah . me , too .
hey ! look at this ! we can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach .
he is so kind . i couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife .
i don ’ t understand .
good morning , mary !
i want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . would you be able to come the next weekend on saturday ?
oh , good . if you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .
i cannot stay here any more minutes .
tom is making so much noise . i have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening .
hello ! let me introduce myself . my name is nancy .
i main market reasearch , and you ?
really ? i don't believe i would met him , is he here now ?
i've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .
i fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . i'm really sorry .
no , thank you .
it's kind of you to say . i feel a little stupid .
when you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway .
there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio .
it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area .
no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here . this is what is called a tornado watch . that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado .
yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming . so it's called a watch .
yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning . so if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere .
well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .
that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they're very loud .
maybe . it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast . others aren't so fast .
hello . is this ann ?
yes , it's me .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i'm in bed with a fever .
i'd like to do it , of course . but i just can't . i'm afraid i'd fall down in the middle of it .
why not just tell him i'm sick ? i'll ring him myself this afternoon .
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway , i have a flu . i know what it is . i don't need a doctor to tell me that .
i'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
yes , that's what i plan to do . except i won't make the chicken soup . right now i don't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
yeah , i'm very nauseous . it ' s mostly nausea and a fever .
thanks , ann . talk to you this afternoon .
why don't you watch where you're going ?
there was plenty of room for me to pull out . you didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
listen , let's just wait until the police get here . then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
i have a cell phone in my car . now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don't you get it for me , and then i can call the police ?
it doesn't work . it looks like it's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
damn it ! i'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police .
it really hurts .
to hell with you . the accident was your fault .
hello , bessie .
thanks a lot . i'm so touched .
i have some good news for you .
jenny is getting married .
tom , that lucky guy .
last week , it said that he fell in love with jenny at mrs . whit ' s party last monday as soon as he saw her .
july 4 , the national holiday .
jenny plans to hold it in church .
guess !
you know , tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man .
hi , mary , i didn't see you at work this morning . are you all right ?
oh , i'm so sorry to hear that . have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ?
are you feeling better ?
do you need anything , grocery ?
in my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ?
do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ?
yes , it's very great .
you are right , mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding arrangement , costs , etc . i think he must spend much money .
yes . look ! mary is going to throw the bride bouquet .
what a nice tie you are wearing !
certainly . it matches your suit perfectly .
this is my house . let me show you around it .
follow me to the back yard .
we had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning .
here is the swimming pool and we can swim later .
yes , please . i'm a little thirsty , actually .
coffee , please .
would you like to talk over a drink ?
shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ?
how about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ?
really ? you guys must be really tight .
he seems sincere , and trustworthy .
what do you mean ?
oh , my ! really ? i never thought he would be like that .
so , can i trust him or what ?
but i need someone that i can count on for this job .
come on you're confusing me . give it to me straight .
my friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry .
she's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self esteem , has improved drastically . she ' s very happy .
do you have any plans for next sunday evening ?
my friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her .
do you still see the people we went to school with ?
yeah , i've lost touch with most people as well , but i still see rose occasionally .
ok , i suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , she got divorced .
do you feel all right ? you look pale .
have you taken your temperature ?
how long have you been feeling this way ?
oh , probably you've been working too hard .
here comes the birthday cake .
be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff .
yes , but i doubt if i get it . i've never get it .
hello ? is that mark ?
i've been overseas , so have you been busy lately ?
yes , i was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing .
that sounds good . i've missed you my friend .
happy birthday , mary !
i had my own ways of finding out . it ' s a secret . you look so beautiful today . your new shirt goes well with your skirt .
really ? it looks so nice .
all right .
no , thanks . i've had enough . now , mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . after that , you may cut the cake .
no , just a small one . next let's sing happy birthday to mary .
oh ! you're engaged ! what a beautiful engagement ring ! who to ?
when's the wedding going to be ?
are you having a big wedding ?
but what do you say about that ?
then i'll take them . how much ?
here is $ 150 . keep the change .
how do you like your job here , linda ?
why ?
i'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . most of the work is boring .
yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .
it ’ s a wonderful party , joan , the food , the drink , the atmosphere . everyone is enjoying himself .
bottoms up ! by the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ?
oh , how wonderful ! every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys .
thank you . steven . that was the most magnificent meal i've had abroad . you ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in beijing .
we don't .
at hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary .
in a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . i generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities .
cooking is a hobby with me . i'm always trying to think up new recipes . i hope you like the soup . it's kind of a specialty of mine , so i hope you enjoy it .
thank you for your compliment . won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? i'm rather round of it .
what sort of western food do you like best ?
i find the chinese dishes wonderful .
my wife and i didn't used to spend this much money .
my wife has been pregnant for 7 months .
my wife will be going back to work soon .
how was the party yesterday ?
oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! it was the most awful evening i've ever had .
well . john had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . i waited for a full hour in the cold wind .
it gives me great pleasure to introduce mr . eh mr .
may i have your attention please ?
mumm . those burgers smell great . it's perfect day for a barbecue .
oh , hi ! i'm barbara johnson . nice to meet you .
barbara . but please , just call me barb .
i'm studying medicine .
at harvard . what about you ?
oh , are you ? that sounds interesting .
hey , rose , how are you feeling ?
oh , look at the baby . it ' s so beautiful . is it a boy or a girl ?
oh , how adorable ! she's got your eyes .
when are you returning home ?
i heard rose is pregnant . i hope it'll be a boy this time .
after three baby girls in a row , rose is under a lot of pressure from her in laws . they want a boy in the worst way now .
hello .
sure , just a minute . mark , you're wanted on the phone .
hi ! this is jill . how come you didn't come in today ?
that's too bad . you ' ll have to be more careful nest time .
no , nothing special . oh , yes , you know bill , the guy with the moustache . his wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today , he said his wife and daughter are doing fine . the baby is their first child .
yes , we have to . do you think you can make it tomorrow ?
so , paula , where are you from ?
from canada ? where were you born ?
when did you come to los angeles ?
did you go to school here ?
when was that ?
i bet that was interesting . what did you do there ?
i want to say goodbye to everyone .
you really don ’ t need to .
i hope so , too . thank you , lily . thank you for everything .
please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
thank you . remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in washington .
oh , god . it ’ s late . i ’ m afraid i have to leave .
thank you for your hospitality .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ’ ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like , i promise .
well . i really do have to go .
hi , martin . i ’ ve been looking for you all morning .
yes .
thank you .
me too . i ’ ll write to you once i get settled . but i have so much to do . you might have to wait a while . but i really will write to you . i love to write letters . i think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call .
thank you .
how do you do . i ’ m mark rancor .
may i know your name , please ?
i did but now i ’ m for microsoft . how are things with you ?
may i know what you do ?
sure . that would be great . good luck .
have you ever been to japan ? i'm going in the fall .
really ? tell me about it . what's it like ?
what did you think of tokyo ?
yeah . i've seen pictures of the crowds !
how was the weather ?
kathy ! how are you ? it's been ages ! what are you doing these days ?
you're kidding ! you've always hated cooking !
when did you change your mind ?
i still can't believe it ! so , did you go to cooking school or something ?
really ? how long did you stay there ?
and what did you do after that ?
so , what do you think ? how do you like new york ?
yeah . i really like the stores and the shopping .
but the traffic is pretty bad .
listen , it's almost dinnertime . there are lots of restaurant around here . what do you want to try ? italian ? greek ? japanese ? thai ?
hello , ann ! is that you ?
it's been a long time ! what's new ?
not bad i guess . i just got back from hawaii .
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . don't let me hold you up .
ok , i won't keep you then .
yes , stay in touch . bye !
i really should be on my way .
no , thank you . i can ’ t .
thank you very much . i had a really good time .
that would be great ! actually , can i get your phone number , ella ? that ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if i call you sometime .
ok , got it . i ’ ll call you sometime next week .
it ’ s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
i am having an exam at nine , it's already eight thirty .
thank you very much !
very well , thanks , i will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , i have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . i can feel it .
welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , sir . please have a seat .
thank you .
let me show you the way . please follow me .
my pleasure .
oh , hi pam . when did you get back from canada ? how was it ?
which city did you like better ?
and what's montreal like ? what did you think of it ?
which one has better nightlife ?
hi rose , what are you busy with right now ?
well , rose ,
are your free this weekend ?
great , is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?
i'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
is 5 pm . a good time for you ?
sure , that would be great . i'll bring the wine .
i can't stand the stupid guy any longer . it ' s unbelievable !
he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
i have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
i think that's a bad idea . i'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
yes he ' s in his office .
don't take any chances . it'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . he's already mad at you for last 2 times . any more and he might fire you .
hello , kevin . i hate to do this , but i have to cancel our appointment .
yeah , i really wanted to come , too . but something unexpected in shanghai have come up . i have to fly out for a few days , but i'll be back soon .
i should have some free time next week . say , next wednesday evening ?
yeah , i'm expecting to come back on tuesday .
i had the same feeling when i first came to work here . but after a period of time , i feel better , i am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .
you know the phrase , the survival the fittest . we have no choices .
jane , i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , i was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
what about sunday ?
maybe next week .
sorry to hear that , i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , i really enjoyed our last chat .
if you are free , maybe you can get having for my birthday party , it should be fun .
no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
i hear that tom got divorced , and i don ’ t know how he is now .
i hear that mary got mad .
what ’ s wrong with her ?
it is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control .
what can we do ?
hi charles , i want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian .
yeah , i am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ?
around seven .
no , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold up chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ?
don't worry , i will come to pick you up at about six thirty .
oh , you are out of breath ! what ’ s happened ?
that it easy . they get caught before they come here .
the country is strong only in appearance . don ’ t you think so ?
he can repair cares ? i cannot believe it .
when she told me that she would marry no man but dick , my heart was almost in my mouth .
i could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like dick . he plays the field with many girls .
mrs . smith , you are always worried about your children .
hi , kenji .
do you mean the bangkok ?
sure , i'd love to .
any time after 6 o'clock is good for me . oh ! i'm late ! i have a class .
hello . could i speak to justin , please ?
oh , hi justin . this is karen hepburn . we met at chris and jim's party .
great . uh , justin , would you like to see otis lesley on thursday night ? he's at the kangaroo club .
oh . that's too bad .
actually , are you doing anything on friday or saturday ? he's playing those two nights as well .
at eight sharp . how about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ?
sure !
our son is gone and my heart is gone too . i don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years .
i feel life is meaningless without him .
my mother likes to split hairs .
she has keen to buy something which is much cheaper .
i am tired of everything in my life .
you don ’ t know that i have been over protected by my mother these years . i am really about to leave the family and spread my wings .
ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one .
we must set 1000 dollars aside each month .
we are going to buy our own house .
you are in love with mary , right ?
look out ! your tea water is running over .
sure .
john passed away .
yesterday . he suffered from a serious disease . when he saw the red light , it was too late .
he never see eye to eye with me .
are you telling us a lie again ?
all right . but what was the trouble ?
your face is so red , you must running a temperature .
please go to see a doctor .
mary and i decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair .
don ’ t make a fuss . many people divorce after having living together for many years .
you seem to be unhappy . what happened ?
what does the doctor say ?
i hear that helen does not relate very well to her husband .
don ’ t do that again . you are riding the tiger .
you will ask for it .
jenny is going to marry another man next month .
but , how can you be so calm . you loved her so much .
have you met john recently ?
yes , he has been like that since his accident .
mary , i heard you moved again .
you mean noise ? how could it be ?
what is up ?
oh , don ’ t be angry . i just thought you might need them sometime .
mike promised to help us .
why not ?
mary is such a cautious girl !
she never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others .
he told the police that ted was the murderer .
why do you say so ?
do you know that mary an ben have already separated ?
we quarreled yesterday , and he picked up and left .
i am not sure .
i have no idea about what to do next .
i want to try my hand at the stocks .
don ’ t worry . i know there are no pennies from heaven . i will work hard .
but i put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that .
he is penny wise and pound foolish .
who broke the glass , peter ?
i was not born yesterday . it must be either you or adam .
how i wish my son mark could be as excellent as your joe !
he thought he could take jimmy in , but you know , jimmy is no fool .
so jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg .
you know why ?
can you believe that susan got married ?
no . that ’ s what is surprising me .
he ’ s a postman .
in my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house .
i ’ m not sure now . in any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations .
how are you going all these days ?
but you look depressed .
is it serious ?
how about your family ?
are you really dating with frank ?
then why not keep away from him ?
she has contributed to a new school .
i hear the school is very modern . it has the best equipments .
i always feel i ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on .
what do you think of frank ?
why do you say that ?
susan has got married .
her marriage was a hole and corner affair .
have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ?
can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ?
by the way , are you going to the concert tomorrow ?
the murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment .
yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood .
i don ’ t dare to look after the children now .
the children always make themselves in danger . i always have my heart in my mouth with them .

thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence .
yes , please . it ' s very kind of you .
the rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well . you are very helpful . i want to thank you for everything you've done for me .
i bought you some books on literature , i don't know if you would like them .
have you received your towel test results yet ?
congratulations ! i knew you could do it .
thank you , but it was your hard work that did it .
i'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor .
i know he has brought great trouble to you . a million thanks .
hello , bobby , it seems that i can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock .
i'm so sorry , i've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . i'd have arrived but for that .
thirty meters ahead is the waterloo bridge .
i've thought of that , but what can i do with my car ? if only i had taken a taxi !
i'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting .
why , tom ? it's five to six already and you are still writing here .
yes , have you forgotten ? we have arranged to go to mary's to watch some videos tonight .
what's the matter with you ? you are the one that persuaded all of us to go there .
and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long .
everyone in our class enjoyed it too . it ' s very interesting .
would you mind me keeping it for another three days ?
you shouldn't have told her the truth . what can we do now ?
you are always like this . i've told you many times not to tell her .
we can't wait any longer .
you'll knock yourself out the way you've worked . why don't you slow down ?
all right . now that everybody's here . shall we be getting started ? miss lin , are you ready ?
excuse me , miss lin . would you mind speaking up , please ? i can't hear you very well .
what's the matter with you then ? you look miserable .
i . i . i miss my parents , also they miss me .
you mean i am groaned a few words ?
i ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it .
it ’ s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ?
many happy returns of the day , darling ?
and here is your birthday present .
do you like it ?
you ’ re all set now ?
really , it was nothing .
i was happy to help .
don ’ t mention it .
excuse me . may i take a picture of you and your little boy ?
it ’ s for a book .
diana , do you like the perfume i gave you ?
i ’ m sorry . i didn ’ t know that .
shall we for go out for a meal this evening ?
we can go to that new chinese restaurant .
come on , let ’ s try it .
does 7 o'clock suit you ?
how about a snack after work ?
would you rather stay home ?
are you really interested in doing something ?
look ! it ’ s the start of the olympic games .
really ? congratulations !
by the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? tomorrow is my birthday .
not so soon . it ’ s not my birthday today . well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?
i ’ ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening .
helen is nice but she talks a lot .
i can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job .
but i don't even know what to study .
that's what my parents want me to do .
but if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun .
and if you try to find a part time job , you'll have some money too .
where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty pm ?
are you sure you cann't remember ?
were you in or out ? can you remember that ?
did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
sure ?
do you take a bus to and from work ?
hmm . i have the same problem . when i leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . so the buses are always crowded .
that sounds terrible the way you describe it . but you know , not long ago i really suffered on the bus .
you just can ’ t imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full , so i waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . then i decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding !
you were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
alice , your father is amazing . he ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house .
that sounds like my grandmother . she was always stubbornly independent .
they see their independence as a kind of character strength .
susan , i am inviting you and frank to our house warming party this weekend .
yes , deborah and i are going to buy a new home in woodlawn .
well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive .
that ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
you ’ re almost 70 years old , mom ! don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?
do you ever get lonely living alone ?
hi , my name ’ s karl . my wife and i are moving in next door .
i ’ m happy to meet you . it seems everyone in town is so friendly .
well , i ’ m from chicago . there few people take the time to get to know their neighbors .
i saw an interesting program on tv last night . it was about elderly people .
it said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier .
and the tv program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .
hey , jane . are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ?
i've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies . but it looks like i'm going to need to make a claim .
i have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ?
hummum . i think i'll have to talk to the doctor again about that . anyway . now that i'm going to have to make some claims , i think i'd better try and understand how the system works . would you mind breaking it down for me ?
that's the charge for insurance i see on my pay slip each month , right ?
so workman's compensation is if i slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ?
so , fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?
that's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
not really , they just don't want me living at home . my older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .
my parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . they think that it's important that i should learn how to live on my own .
seven children ? that's a lot . why did your parents have so many ?
jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .
like what ? i assume that there's no privacy .
and the age gap is also annoying . there's a ten year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common .
well , at least going to college won't be too bad . since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college .
darling , i have news for you . bobby and his wife , evelyn , are going to have a baby soon .
actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday .
in fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is american and the other one is chinese .
it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now .
do you have much experience with kids ?
to tell you the truth , sometimes i regret having a baby so early . i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .
what about your mother ? did she help you ?
i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just don ’ t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day .
sounds not so easy to me . when that happens , i will be too old to learn .
hi , anna . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . where have you been ?
no wonder i haven ’ t seen you recently . where did you spend your holidays ?
no , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . we haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . the first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . we spent our honeymoon in the alps .
how good are you at sports , bill ?
wow !
well , i guess i exercise about two hours a day . i do aerobics three times a week , and the other days i play badminton with my husband . i always feel good afterward .
well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? it ’ s difficult , but very rewarding .
i can ’ t wait to retire .
and then i ’ m moving to florida where i can play golf all day , every day !
what do you plan on doing after you retire ?
hey , ben . did you catch the game last night ?
baltimore defeated texas by 17 points !
football of course !
no , i'm talking about american football . the world cup is soccer .
so chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ?
oh , certainly . i wouldn't miss a game for the world . my girlfriend says i have an addiction . and actually , if i had to choose between her and my games . i'd probably pick football .
i don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . it seems like you ’ ve got good news everyday .
all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers .
oh , i know . i saw you doing pull ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you .
it ’ s true . many students do the exercise when they have to . we have p . e . once a week .
of course . i didn ’ t know that . i only know exercise makes bodies stronger . i should take some exercise then . do you have any suggestions ?
hi , mr . zhang . what ’ s wrong ? you don ’ t look so happy . how was your date ?
me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are .
believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants .
hi , kate .
yeah , i saw someone walking like you , but i wasn ’ t sure . we haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
wow ! that ’ s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know , old habits are hard to break .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that ’ s not hard . i can do that .
hey , shirley ! want to join me for lunch . my treat !
i really want to pick your brain about something i've been thinking a lot about .
well , as you know , i have a bachelor's degree in english literature and that's served me well so far , but i've always wanted to do some post graduate work . maybe even get a doctorate !
but you have a master's degree . hasn't that helped your career ?
i know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . call me crazy , but i've always wanted to have that phd at the end of my name .
i certainly can't afford it , but i'm sure i could find some good student loans .
yeah . i keep thinking about what i'll do with a master's or doctorate . i love language but i don't think there are a lot of well paying jobs out there for experts on shakespeare .
hey claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . is something wrong ?
well , stress is a real thing . it's not an imaginary condition .
you're not weak . you're stressed out ! stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators . and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful .
but you're actually having the same reaction as our tree dwelling ancestors ! it's called the flight or fight response . each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight . it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body .
it could . modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . they just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds !
hey susan , what are you coming as this year ?
yeah . for halloween ! we have a big office party tomorrow evening . there's a prize for best costume !
really ! you don't have some kind of chinese ghost festival ?
cool ! a whole month ! what do you do during that month ?
feed them ?
and then later everyone eats the food ?
it makes sense , right ? who else is going to eat it ?
i heard you are going to move .
what are you worried about ?
you can call a mover .
around 200 rib for a truck .
but think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save .
i know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . i ’ ll leave you their phone number .
it ’ s 8357688 8 .
hey , look at the offer i got in my e mail . it says that i can get rich quickly while working at home !
what do you mean ?
but it seems like a good idea . all i have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . after that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .
pyramid scheme ? what is that ?
sounds good to me . the guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .
what happens then ?
hi amanda , how are you ? i've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week .
it's great . i really get to focus on what i like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . however , i'm having a small problem with my new colleagues .
well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person .
what is that ?
who ’ s that ?
oh , please come in . nice to see you .
yeah , i ’ m trying to decorate my house .
but actually it ’ s not done yet . i ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp .
i hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .
oh , i love the roof tiles on spanish style houses .
great , is it a two bedroom house ?
that ’ s a nice area too . it ’ ll be a good investment for you .
not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding .
did you move into your new apartment ?
don ’ t worry . it ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized .
have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ?
what do you mean by that ?
yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent .
is there a supermarket nearby ?
can you believe the headlines ?
i'm reading about michael milliken , the bond king .
he got arrested all right .
yup , that's him . he made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .
that's the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .
yup , you got it . criminals in america do a lot better if they're white collar thieves .
so , jack , do you believe in ghosts ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
it was many years ago , when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night , and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when .
it was a big , green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs .
i hid so that it couldn't see me . slowly it got closer and closer , until .
you have been here for how long ? four months now ?
oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain . it happens almost everywhere .
a shouting match ? you ’ re so funny . you must be exaggerating . i don ’ t believe it .
yes , perhaps . chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .
so do you believe in palmistry ?
it's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future .
are you sure ? i've read a lot about palmistry and i've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong .
hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but .
ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ?
don't forget my friend andy from the office . he has nothing to do on friday , so i invited him over .
i'm not sure . he just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and i don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon .
i think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . it's only a superstition . it really doesn't mean anything .
thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . i was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . is that common ?
your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me .
oh , i didn't think of that . well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china . plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .
she ’ s got quite a crowd around her . oh , look ! that little girl caught it !
i really enjoy the beach in the summer .
we should come here more often .
i'd like to come back next weekend .
have you heard about anlesen david ?
no , they got engaged .
well , my dear . i didn't believe either . but got it straight form the horse's mouth . davi called me this morning .
next june .
well , i can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance .
i know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning .
yes , but americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
two months ? how did you find out ?
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
what'd he do ?
dalian is a beautiful city . do you agree ?
the climate here is pleasant .
this city is really comfortable to living .
no other city can match it . it's heaven .
i'm sorry , but i can't go .
i have to see my daughter .
you are married to a foreigner , huh ? so what ’ s it like ?
yeah , i know what you mean . the first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .
oh , so he ’ s half chinese and half american . that ’ s unusual . what languages does he speak , then ?
what does he look like ? can people tell ?
then why are so many crazy about it
have heard of paul ?
he's got a promotion .
well , it's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
we scored six goals .
and i score three of them .
we had extra time of course .
what do you think of doctor thomson ?
how can you be so sure ?
suit wrote me a letter .
she got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor .
it's not a surprise , is it ? she has always been a hard working student .
do you think they two will get married ?
i think so . yes , they get along so well .
i'm exhausted . my new exercise is so hard .
you thing so ?
tomorrow morning . try it .
are you going to this class this morning ?
you're no able to move after this class .
they ’ ll do the operation for you this friday .
i think it ’ s important to do now . we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
well , what about it ? as it happens i've got two tickets for next thursday evening . i thought perhaps .
but i said thursday . the tickets are for thursday evening .
i see . oh , well some other time perhaps .
i ’ m so excited , mother . oh , a new baby !
and my first nephew . he looks a lot like you , mum . he does .
yes , he does have richard ’ s eyes . the baby even looks like you than richard does .
it ’ s true . michelle is a lot like henry in so many ways . and she is shy with new people just like he is .
how are you , sue ?
congratulations on your success .
and how ’ s your brother ?
fantastic ! please send him my congratulations .
morning , tom .
you seem to be in a hurry .
okay . i won ’ t hold you up then .
david , i ’ m going to china .
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
thank you . i ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
i ’ m sure i will .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
don't worry . he is an acrobat 。
hi , mary , it ’ s been a long time
well , i ’ m doing okay . and how about yourself ?
nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ?
good morning , miss li .
i ’ m sorry that i was absent yesterday .
i feel much better now .
i ’ ve already got it . thanks .
hi , lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again .
nothing special . i had a get together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the internet and read a couple of books which i had been longing for . how about yours ?
excuse me , are you miss green ?
may i introduce myself ?
i ’ m a new student in the school . my name ’ s john .
good morning , linda . how have you been ?
i ’ m sorry to hear that . is there anything else i can do ?
dick , i ’ ve decided not to rent that house .
i ’ ve changed my mind .
well , i think maybe i should find a house that is closer to where i work .
i am not convinced by your explanation . could you explain it ?
i can't accept your excuse . it's five o'clock .
i can ’ t decide what to do today .
don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ?
who ’ s this ? your girl friend ?
how old is she ?
she is tall ?
and she is thin , isn ’ t she ?
i ’ ve got a new boss .
well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes .
and a white sports car .
he is short , well built , and he ’ s got light blond hair .
he has a mustache , if i remember correctly , and a light complexion .
he is in his late thirties .
is this your new teacher ?
is she short ?
what color are her eyes ?
what color is her hair ?
and how old is she ?
jenny , i was wondering . if you eh are you busy this friday ?
oh , what about saturday ? are you free then ?
what about tonight ? do you have plans tonight ?
yes , yes , i want to take you to dinner .
do you like this campus ?
how come ?
oh . it ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped .
what are you grinning about ?
i thought mom said no dating till you are 16 .
all of your friends , what are you planning to do ?
what a party ! i hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish .
i talked to them probably about two weeks ago . yeah , everything is going well .
i am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a christmas kind of in january or february . yeah , depending on when my brother can come in .
did you like the party ?
why ? what had you expected ?
i want take shell on a date , but i don ’ t have much money .
she likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food .
dutch , where is that ?
most of our customers are foreigners . how many foreign languages can you speak , elizabeth ?
and how well can you speak them ?
i see . well , we have a lot of spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any spanish here .
how many languages can you speak ?
how well can you speak them ?
can you help me to translate these sentences into german now ?
can you speak english ?
what else can you speak ?
you're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that .
i don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! that's just the problem . in these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first .
everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . just like we planned ! that may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . you always say that .
i don't know how to adjust my life . would you give me a piece of advice ?
yes , i can't sleep well every night .
i drink a lot of wine .
i sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .
dave , wake up .
it's seven thirty . i want to know who left this note on my desk .
it's a little green post it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen .
are you feeling better today , bill ?
you'd better give up smoking . it's bad for your health .
again ?
vince , i think one of your programmers is spying on us for webtracker .
i won't say who , because i'm not sure yet . but i'll know soon .
it isn't elvin .
how do you get paid ? if you don't mind my asking .
and in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ?
what ? in your cubicle ?
i know what you mean . i can't stand computer geeks .
hey , zina . you're here early today .
i just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . i appreciate it .
what's it like to work with her ?
tell me about it .
your 3 . 5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million .
what if i said no ?
you wouldn't ! if you leave , you'll make nothing .
i used to be down on the sales people until i saw her in action .
most salespeople seem like half brains . zina's definitely an exception .
it's crunch time , isn't it ? i wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now i am .
it would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters .
do you think we'll make it ?
do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to vince ? explain the situation ?
zina , can i talk to you about something personal ?
my boyfriend says i work too much . that i spend more time with you than with him .
he said not to bother coming back . and i said , fine , i won't .
either we'll be millionaires , or we won't . won't have a dime .
so , did you , did you lose your finger ?
almost . ah , you're lucky . um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams .
will you be going back to australia soon ?
hello michael .
we're going to talk about australia . or your going to talk about australia . so first of all how any people live in australia ?
ok . what are the biggest cities ?
ok . um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ?
oh , nice . actually , what is the capital city of australia ?
ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from western style flower arrangement because in ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower .
japanese art ? mm , ikebana ! tea ceremony !
tea ceremony ! it's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl .
yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl
ok , devon , i've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy .
what do you recommend ? what can i do to lose weight ?
yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that i actually exercise a lot .
yeah , so maybe it's my diet .
hello gina ! we've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person !
oh , please don't call me sir . just call me jason .
pretty good . there was a bit of turbulence while we were over the pacific ocean but it wasn't too bad . the worst thing was the guy behind me . he snored all through the night !
the stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason .
not much . but that's ok . i'm a night owl anyway .
i'd love to squeeze in a trip to the great wall .
so will you come to work with us ?
we'll have to negotiate that . it's a possibility .
don't push your luck , dave .
i guess i'm just a little nervous . i'm giving everything i have to invoking , and .
exactly .
how ?
good morning , jason . how did you sleep ?
great ! so , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?
well . i'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . you're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . but . if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price .
for starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . you've got to know what things cost .
ok . steven , you're looking at a picture . please describe what you see !
ok . have you ever been on a double decker bus ?
oh , really . mm ! how much is the fare ?
mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ?
is that how you feel on the bus ?
so , so you're british , do you missing them ?
this place is so quiet and peaceful . it ’ s really different from my pad at city .
i don ’ t know . i don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon .
now that would be hard to live without . we city folks are pretty spoiled .
morning , zina . just wanted to say thanks again !
oh , yeah . i'm glad you mentioned that . i think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
yeah . you don't need to rub it in .
fifteen ? and zina pushed them up to seventy five ?
anyway , i'm still happy i left . i'm working as a freelancer now .
you can say that again !
they work for zina now .

that ’ s really a shame . by the way , who will be the bridesmaid ?
when is your birthday ?
do you usually have a birthday party ?
what would you do at the party ?
do you know when people began to sing the song happy birthday ?
let me tell you the story . in 1892 , patty smith hill and mildred hill wrote a song called good morning to you . but later someone added the words happy birthday to their tune .
how old are you ?
i'm older than you ! i'll be ten on april 14th .

mom , it's ok . i will buy a big car one day . it is faster than the bus .
excuse me . is there any body here ?
i've finished up all my water . i would kill for a sip of water .
thank you very much . are you here alone ?
it means a hiker who loves traveling around the world .
yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . i love traveling places .
you can do it . but do work hard on your english to make it easier .
you look great !
so you are happy that you made the decision to join us .
what's that ?
it's not good to start with too much work out at the beginning . what about trying something else ?
more and more people are warm up to yoga these days . do you want to have a try ?
absolutely . but it takes great perseverance to master .
here is a free class going on right over there . go and join them .
welcome , young man . no offence , but i haven't seen you here before .
okay then . you are the younger customer here ever .
it's the marketing's fault , i suppose . what do you want to do ?
that's a long way to go , i'm afraid . first of all , you gotta grow up .
sure . then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope .
please change your clothes first !
sorry , but no jeans here .
mom , this is your third bowl of rice !
why ? i never saw you eat so much before .
so your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work out .
this way you'll probably put on more weight . will you give up ?
then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ?
oh , i've got an idea . why don't you ask dad to go with you ? he badly needs some exercise .
he can just say , i'm benjamin . i'm new and shy .
daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere .
do you know how many people chew gum everyday ?
just in beijing , people consume 300 , 000 pieces of gum every day .
if all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can .
i just want to remind you to behave yourself .
come back . you haven't paid yet .
but he took some newspaper away without paying .
i see . does he live by himself ?
he must be lonely ?
hey , may , look , is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?
may , i really regret watching it with you last night .
well , i admit . the ghosts were scary .
that's gucci's influence . i love science fiction movies !
don't call me kid . i am a grownup .
of course ! i can watch them without you !
have we sold out all the newspapers for today ?
why are so many extra gifts left here ?
how about giving them to that old man ?
by the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ?
i think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper .
that's true .
what's your little caper ? come home so late ! we are all worried about you .
singing ? at the subway exit ? oh , it sounds like someone needs some money .
honey , just do it next time . have you heard of the real art in the subway station in russia ?
many oil painting exhibitions are there . that is a kind of museum exhibition .
i am sure you will . there are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . and people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train .
i am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up .
he was once a poor man but now he is a man of means .
i didn't expect to see you at this hour . you must have goofed off again .
you'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . he may probably give you the bag .
whatever we do , we should do it above board .
do you know sally ?
why did tom quit the job ?
do you think you'll get the project ?
i see . after all , he's boss's son .
what's his job ?
but mrs . smith hired him to find her lost son .
he has a girlfriend already .
her new girlfriend is a far cry from ann . she is like a breath of fresh air .
john seems to be in high cotton . he may well become a big shot .
what is your idea ?
he is too scared to ask her .
i wonder how sarah and mat are .
doesn't she have any friends ?
such friends are even worse than enemies .
he is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him .
have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ?
i hear that some guys splash all their money about on them .
oh , i understand . she cooks , cleans and takes care of children . is that right ?
i decided to go for this kind of life .
i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst .
we are going to the concert this evening . will you join us .
may , we are fools to hang out at noon . it's dying hot today . my skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun .
the heat is driving crazy and i hate my new hat .
but i bought it to get rid of the heat . now it does nothing but burning my head .
laugh all you want , whatever . we need to get out of the heat .
give me a break . it's not funny .
what's so special today ?
didn't you notice all the roses ?
oh , god . i just forget it .
no . but now he will be in bigger trouble ! what's a boyfriend for ? forget about valentine's day ?
oh , it's clive .
excuse me for a while . clive asked me out to a movie ! do you want to join us ?
so what ?
excuse me . where is q duck ? i remember it was around the second intersection of this street .
yes , definitely .
wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when i first came to china .
this street used to have few stores . but now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere .
me too ! i was lost three times ten years ago . there were no english directions then .
who is that guy ?
what position does he play ?
oh , i love michael jordan . he fills people's lives with great excitement .
kobe is a good player but i heard he is a womanizer .
jordan is a legend , anyway . an idol that no one can replace . i think clive can make a good professional basketball player . he is not just about muscles he also plays smart .
by the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ?
wow , this is drop dead gorgeous .
don't remind me of that . this would be the last time i cut any classes for a basketball game .
i just can't help it . oh , look at clive , he is really a big hit . they are definitely gonna win .
come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up .
thay are coming back to narrow the gap .
a secret weapon . they'd better set up the defense now .
oh , man ! i can't believe it . a slam dunk !
what are you reading ?
aha , fitness consultant . very good , don't you know about the rules in this office ?
well , don't do this again next time . what is it about , anyway ?

daniel , what are you doing here ? aren't you supposed to be at school now ?
well , we shall make it a secret between us .
she is the cheer leader . they are required to put on a performance . look ! here they come .
i want to be like her .
hey , young man ! i'm your sis . don't talk to me like that .
are you out of your mind ?
come on , you are left behind !
you just need more exercise .
i don't care . i want to burn up my fat .
why ?
but i want to burn up more calories !
honey , wait ! i've sprained my ankle .
of course not !
the pain is killing me .
i thought leather shoes will do just as well .
what are you going to do ?
god ! it's freezing !
good afternoon , sir . you are really a regular customer here . may i ask you why you come here so often ?
i see . but isn't it a bit too noisy ?
all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
which country makes the best coffee in the world ?
i agree . i heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . is that true ?
no , we don't , especially the old people . but more and more young people fall for coffee .
hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? gatorade or water ?
yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . one for each .
we should choose from the backups .
that ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . otherwise , the game is not worth the candle .
yes , i played shooting guard , i like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , ok ?
wow , the cheer section is coming . the music is so fantastic .
well , you should ask your friend . you know i ’ m not the boss . just kidding .
yeah , what ’ s up ?
hurry up ! mom , i can't wait any more .
ok , mom . can i swim now ? i want to learn butterfly stroke .
mom , it's so terrible . water went down into my throat and i almost got drowned .
oh , mom , i think i'm not the right person for swimming .
really ? i can't believe it . everything is possible to a willing heart .
yes , like a dolphin . am i on the right track ?
look , daddy is on again . don't you think he is handsome ?
the seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else .
of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game .
rockets vs lakers . yao ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience .
in 2002 . and since then he has attracted more attention than ever .
oh , you know something . he is 2 . 26 meters tall . but he is also nimble and skillful .
yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game .
never mind . after all he is not so attractive as yao ming , right ?
hey , daniel , how's it going ?
wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . what had happened ?
did your teacher tell you the route he took ?
great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?
good , by the way , do you finish reading the book robinson crusoe i've bought for you ?
you should speed up , because the story of robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .
that's my boy ! wait , daniel , when is pirates of the caribbean on ?
exactly , now , tell me the time .
yeah , i see . you are just doing your job . but i wanna know what the advantages it has .
is it very dangerous ? i'm a little scared . do you offer the lifebuoy for us ?
do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ?
hey , shirley . the party has been wonderful . my husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too .
i surely will . by the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ?
my children would like that ; they like dancing very much .

hello , let me introduce myself . i'm your neighbor . my name is shirley .
nice to meet you , too .
here is a little gift for your family . it's a calendar with all the community events on it . i hope it can be helpful .
since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me .
oh , don't worry about that here . there are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . you know , they are all very strong .
of course . there is a carrefour near the neighborhood . i'll show you there if you want to .
by the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . i hope i can see you there .
look ! mom , that's amazing ! i can't believe the girls have so neat movements .
there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming .
wow , mom is more knowledgeable than dad . i must learn from you .
ok , you're the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
i don't know how john can put up with his son , who fools around without working .
hi , i'm benjamin . nice to meet you here . you look great .
no , this is the second time . but i also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag .
no , before the in dynasty .
do you like watching the winter olympic games ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
yeah . what's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
i see . then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ?
oh , that's new to me . so what's on everyday ?
is there anything interesting ?
i agree . are there any commercials on the tv ?
that makes a lot of sense . does the tv work well ?
i got it . do you pay for the programs ?
look ! someone is celebrating his birthday .
why ? do you know that guy ?
that's interesting . but it would be really expensive , i suppose . just think about all the drinks .
wow . that's wonderful .
hey . i'm a visitor from china . i love your music . it's the best i've ever heard . will you please spare a little bit of time for me ?
oh , you wrote them all by yourself . that's amazing ! are you a regular singer here ?
cool . your guitar skills are very impressive . how did you learn to play like that ?
may , is the university a terrible place ?
because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . so i figure you would study even harder after you ’ ve got in .
how do you know that ? you haven't got in yet .
oh , really ? were you not caught ?
what do you want to study in the university ? have you thought about it ?
i will choose what i like . you don't know what a torture it is for me to study english , because i don't like english .
you can decide later . you will have choices before you submit your university application form .
wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . now , i can see why it's called the lantern festival . it deserves its name .
what are they doing over there ? people keep on gathering there .
sure . but you know that i can't read any chinese characters . what do they say ?
very interesting . but i'm afraid we'd better do something else . hey , look ! there is a huge lantern there . let's get close to it .
really ? then i'm really lucky . oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth .
there are many chinese characters on its body , too . what are they about ? puzzles ?
dad , i want to learn how to drive this summer vacation .
i will get registered now at once . do you know any training schools ?
3 , 000 yuan is a little bit steep .
i've heard that the ideal life school is famous . they offer many programs and there are many classes available . the charge is also fair .
may , look , what's that in the cage ?
of course i know . i just can't see it very well .
of course , bamboo !
i also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship .
not really , panda is my favorite animal .
yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from australia are very famous .
daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ?
yes , of course .
there are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting .
there , you only have two ways for visiting .
on their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region .
because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . you can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be .
yes .
i've heard the hitchhiker would be on next week . i want to see it .
yeah , i love horror movies the most . would you like to go with me next weekend ?
well , what kind of movies do you like ?
in a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies .
not quite . i also like romance and comedy movies very much .
so we can relax now .
how time flies !
i can still remember our first date .
yeah , oh my god ! it's still there . we have our first date right on there .
you were dull at that time .
look , forest gump is on at six thirty .
yeah , i am very impressed with tom hanks ' performance in the movie .
life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get .
you know , it also won 6 oscar awards in 1995 . unbelievable !
yes , the forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble .
gucci , i have an idea . do you want to see this movie together ?
hey , may . how about getting together for a movie tonight ?
well , let me check the newspaper . what about the terminal ?
well , birds of a feather flock together . i like her too . she was in a lot of dramas .
what's more , she doesn't have scandals . and she likes to take part in the charitable activities .
steven spielberg . another superstar .
can you introduce the story of the terminal briefly ?
the stepmother was very wicked . she couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
do you believe in ufos ?
you mean that you can them .
they come to the earth ?
aliens from the outer space ? do you talk to them ? what do they look like ?
that means that you talk to them ? in which language ?
nice weather , honey !
may and daniel often like this kind of weather .
honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ?
since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time .
yes , i remember last year this time , the weather is so hot .
daniel loves the beach very much !
what do you think of the lawyer's speech ?
would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ?
it seldom rains this summer .
because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
poor ann . she did not love her husband at all .
what do you think of his behaviour yesterday ?
they got a divorce at last .
you said it . love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
what will happen to the children if you break up ?
why don't you make up with john .
it's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy .
i am not certain about that .
your husband is very helpful , isn't he ?
you seem to like her very much , don't you ?
but i heard that she had a three year old girl .
may doesn't get along very well with her mother in law .
poor john ! he is bothering both sides of this bread .
where is john ? i can't find him anywhere .
what ? beg your pardon .
you know that ? dan got a divorce .
yeah . but his relation with sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife .
what will you do now ? propose to her .
you should strike while the iron is hot .
does tom drink a lot ?
what did her boss say to you ?
you look pale recently .
take good care of yourself .
you are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ?
just because he gets on well with everybody ?
you seem to very busy these days . what are you doing ?
where did you spend your holiday ?
to be a revolutionary needs great courage !
galileo is one of them .
you seem depressed these days . what's the matter ?
if i can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know .
the woman was beaten again . why didn ’ t she call the police .
it is incredible .
okay , can i ask you something direct ?
fair enough . give it to me straight . did she bully you into this ?
how did he know that he had bad mouthed him ?
he is then in a very difficult situation .
thanks for offering to give me a lift . i'm looking forward to this party , but i didn't want to go alone .
no , this is my first . last week i went to a cookout 5 for new professors at dean barksdale's home . i took a taxi because i didn't want to be late . but i was the first one there .
you're right . the invitation said two to seven . i was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . they didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock .
thanks for telling me this .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said , dinner at eight , and it's only seven fifteen . i don't want to be the first one there again .
merry christmas !
i said merry christmas ! don't you know that christmas is almost here ?
huh ? didn't you know ? aren't you excited ?
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
oh , i'm sorry . i didn't know .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well , would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
your tree looks beautiful . do you decorate it this way every year ?
well , everything seems to be just about ready . now all we need is snow . do you exchange the presents in the morning ?
thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs .
the city is beautiful , the off . , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
i've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
which church do you attend ?
what ’ s the difference between this and other churches ?
then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ?
do you believe that mormons have all of it ?
why do you really go to church ?
henry married rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?
but he seems to be very happy with rose .
i wonder if i can ask you a question .
well . er . it is just . just that i .
i . er . i just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks .
what's wrong with her .
congratulations to you .
you want to go with him ?
oh , it costs too much . it's more expensive than the public school .
he must be regretting about having done the business .
is this watch yours ?
let me have a look . it's mine . i have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . it's present from my father .
this small town has many serious problems .
i feel pity for the old man .
it must be dreadful to grow old .
you look pale , you must have poor health .
have you ever thought about tom ’ s attitude ?
why are you cut up recently , nancy ?
oh , cheer up . a boyfriend is not everything .
where is tom ?
what ? it ’ s only 9 p . m . now . why today he went to bed so early ?
what did he say ?
it ’ s too good to be true ! if i were there , i would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
it is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas .
the government is making efforts to change situation .
you married joe , didn't you ?
i remember you are in love .
john hasn't got married up to now .
really ? does mary know that ?
i'm exhausted . my new exercise class is so hard ,
you thing so ?
tomorrow morning . try it .
are you going to this class this morning ?
you're no able to move after this class .
you want to bet ?
linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ?
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
where do you usually do your shopping , mrs . lane ?
how do you find the prices there ?
i see you have bought some coffee . would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ?
you're from new york , aren't you ?
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
no , i don't like museums . they're boring .
an interesting meeting , isn't it ?
sorry , what was your last name again ?
and what do you do , ted ?
salesman ?
i work for american airlines .
you're not looking happy . what's the matter ?
with the job ?
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
what do you mean ?
you need a holiday . that's what's the matter .
when can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? next saturday ?
does 6 thirty suit you ?
please think it over .
come on , dear . i know you mustn ’ t forget it .
ur , you really let me down .
no , you haven ’ t . you just don ’ t care about me . you ’ re an indifferent husband .
what's the date today mr . brown ? i don't have a calendar .
25th sep ? oh , i have an appointment tonight .
it is at 8 o'clock .
i have to go now . i don't want to be late .
do i need a visa ?
that ’ s very kind of you , helen . i hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . i need a holiday . it won ’ t be long .
that was a great party . thanks for staying behind to help me clear up .
i ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
yes , he ’ s very good isn ’ t he ? he told some funny stories too .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
that ’ s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ?
that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes , so i think everyone liked it a lot . how ’ s that stain ?
you know john ?
yes . i ’ ve read news about him in today ’ s paper .
i wish he could too .
he ’ s a bit tired , you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up .
there are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . the city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs .
i think that there are too many of them . i think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . they should have lower prices instead . then they would see more .
i really hate receiving spam . i also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway .
i like that too . i don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something .
what ’ s your working day like ?
do you get paid onetime ?
do you have any breaks ?
my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?
yes , i do . i don ’ t like it very much .
i ’ d love to have my own farm .
i wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .
that ’ s one reason i ’ d like to try it . i ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office .
my uncle owns a farm and i ’ ve spent some time working with him . i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .
what kinds of tv programs do you enjoy watching ?
i like those kinds of programs too . they ’ re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .
no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs .
what do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ?
so , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?
how can a business maximise revenues ?
what else do you suggest ?
what ’ s your city like ?
is the traffic bad in the city centre ?
what about restaurants and entertainment ?
is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?
it sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
aren ’ t you interested in watching the olympics ? there have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world .
i think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event .
i think the olympics help to promote world peace .
you are so pessimistic ! the olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . most people hope to see someone from their country win , but i think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete .
i wish that i were good at the discus , but i could rarely throw it in the right direction ! i was awful . with the hurdles , i could never jump over them !
no , i was good at the long jump . i liked the sprints best .
do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? i want to check the results from the world athletics championship .
yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . i watched that on tv . what other events did we win ?
that ’ s great . those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . they must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win .
that ’ s amazing ! were any other records broken ?
did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? it was very exciting . one competitor made two false starts .
i was just watching a documentary on tv about how people use dogs for various purpose . it was very interesting .
the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
yes , i can . i don ’ t ride regularly though . how about you ?
what are you doing ?
the thing that i find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny .
rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon .
yes , there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries .
that doesn ’ t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs , then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them .
what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ?
perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops .
we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .
i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways .
have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .
i watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . it was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .
well . there was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .
no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because i ’ d like to see it in action .
according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .
your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . the flowers are really colorful .
yes , i do . those are violets , aren ’ t they ?
the lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . would you like me to cut them off for you ?
when the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree .
first , i ’ ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
how do you research your books ?
i really like your books . i ’ ve just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
oh ! thank you very much . i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . what are the stories about ?
which countries have you been to ?
i thought you had been to australia too .
i think i'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains .
well , the north of norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .
ok . let ’ s look at our short presentation on china . what do we need to include ?
ok . china is about the same size as canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1 . 3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population .
we need to say something about the geography and climate of china . is there any way to divide the country into sections ?
that sounds very general .
one from each part ? lhasa , urumqi , harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . the capital city is beijing , right ?
hi , mark ! long time no see !
where have you been ?
how was your flight ?
did you have a layover ?
did you buy anything in the duty free stores ?
oh , you didn ’ t have to .
what ’ s the difference between football and rugby ?
in rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?
i know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?
there ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?
the ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?
hello . nice to see you again . i heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . i hope everything ’ s ok .
i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
it must have really hurt afterwards .
i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
how do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ?
i think we just need to build more roads . then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams .
i don ’ t know . i think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . they already pay a lot of tax petrol tax , for example .
the air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . the problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . it well be unpopular .
did you hear about car accident on spring road yesterday ?
yes . i heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems .
yes . he was released from hospital yesterday evening . the other man could be there for weeks .
the hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . what does that mean ?
is your city a historical place ?
how did it grow into such a large place ?
as the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
do they have a good team ?
how many more games are there this season ?
hello ! how are you .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
perhaps you ’ ve been working too hard . you do have a high pressure job .
well . i ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
i'm really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
you might think this strange , but i like the category for “ best foreign language film .
you ’ re a big fan of andy lau , aren ’ t you ?
how come you don ’ t have all of his films on dvd ?
i see . i ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
i think that show biz stars have a really easy life . they have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they ’ re famous , so everyone loves them .
no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party .
i don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they ’ re overpaid , over ambitious , and over adored .
hi ! i see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .
i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .
when you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?
when you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do , you might get a lot of spam unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things .
take this web page for example . press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again .
i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous , i ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle .
no one really believes gossip columnists .
i think you ’ re right about that . i ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . i could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people .
i love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity .
hi ! is that the new laptop you brought last week ? it looks very nice .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
that ’ s great . can you do it anywhere ?
i know you are keen on photography . it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime !
do you use an anti virus program to protect your computer ?
how often do you run your anti virus program ?
which anti virus program would you recommend ?
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
what do you use your computer for ?
how often do you use the internet ?
yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
yes , i like the job though . sometimes , i help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .
i think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . first , a lot of the information you find online is false . second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
how do you think they could be ended ?
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .
well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the two just don ’ t go together .
people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do .
just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
do you believe in god ?
i ’ m not sure . why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?
i basically believe in science over theology . i mean , i believe in evolution for example . however , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .
for example ?
i can ’ t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice !
but it ’ s so old .
no , not at all .
i didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . what ’ s the main storyline ?
why does he want to do that ?
won ’ t they get his inheritance ?
i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all .
there ’ s movie ? my teacher didn ’ t tell me that !
it would take a lot less time .
do you think children watch too much tv ?
perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don ’ t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first .
they could go out and play with their friends .
hi ! what are you watching ?
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
why do they go there ?
when muslims pray , they face towards mecca .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .
pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
what ’ s the plot of your new movie ?
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ ve made recently . does that bother you ?
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
thank you very much for doing this interview .
which language do you speak ?
yes , i do . i ’ m learning chinese now on the internet .
it ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good .
actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they ’ re easy for me .
yes . how are the spanish classes going ?
hi , charlie ! what are you reading ?
who ’ s it about ?
who is he ?
who ’ s the author ?
what do you think about it ?
can i read it when you ’ re done ?
how many chapters does the book have ?
when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ?
thanks . charlie !
shall we go to cinema this evening ? the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . it ’ s supposed to be really good .
it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
what did the critic say ?
the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
what are you reading ?
it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language .
does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english speaking world ?
right . all the people who speak chinese . hindi , french and spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages .
are you an art aficionado ?
i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
art isn ’ t for everyone . i ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
i thought i ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there .
how many people are in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there ’ s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
about seven years now . and you ?
it ’ s becoming more and more common . however , i don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
if that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in laws !
the art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . he says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned .
i liked it . i didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion .
i like landscapes and still life . you prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?
i agree . i prefer oils too . i collect landscapes , but i only have a small collection . you have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?
i ’ m going to the beauty parlor . do you want to come too ?
i want to have a foot massage and haircut .
good idea . we should also pedicures and manicures .
i think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don ’ t you agree ?
maybe we should try a thai massage too .
that ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet .
are you interested in history ?
i love history , but i ’ ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
some people say that history repeats itself .
the idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
who is cindy ’ s husband ?
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
do they have any grandchildren ?
does their daughters get along well with her in laws ?
when you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that ’ s what i thought . i just thought i ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?
did you ? how is he these days ?
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
do you like barry ?
i agree . i like his brother , paul . they are not alike .
oh , i don ’ t think you ’ re shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
you ’ re right . i love going out and making new friends .
how old is keith ?
he ’ s a year older than keith , but he looks younger .
he ’ s fine . he retired last week . it ’ s turning going in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
oh , i don ’ t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
how do you want to spend your old age ?
don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ?
so why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents .
you might be right . i guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . you know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv .
maybe some of it . i think a lot of people blame tv and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly .
yes , that ’ s true . your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ?
i've heard you're going to america tomorrow . i want to see you off at the airport .
what airline and what flight ?
i'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty p . m .
that girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ?
i ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . he ’ s very broad shouldered .
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i ’ m so tall myself .
no , never . i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
what do you do for a living ?
really ? do you like it ?
i ’ m a bus driver .
what does she do ?
does she go to night school ?
why ? what does she want to be ?
what classes does she take ?
excuse me , sir . could you spare a minute ?
do you go to work by train every day ?
and would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ?
why do you say that ?
which train do you catch in the evening ?
and can you get a seat ?
would you agree that the service is fast ?
morning , bob . fancy meeting you here !
well , i thought i'd come to see you , so here i am .
i'm sorry to hear that . take care of yourself .
sounds wonderful . when shall we make it ?
ok .
how are you ?
i haven ’ t seen you for several days .
what ’ s he doing ?
good evening . welcome to our program .
would you tell us your name , please ?
glad to meet you , ms . baker .
where are you from , ms . baker ?
good morning , mr . jones !
nice to see you again .
how is everything ?
quite well , thank you .
no , i was driven by my husband .
yes , thanks .
london is such a historical city ! there ’ s history everywhere you look . there ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . he won the battle of trafalgar in 1805 .
nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of boadicea . she fought the romans when they invaded britain .
she was a very controversial leader . are we going to visit the famous tower of london later ?
i ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . i really want to see the crown jewels too .
where ’ s that ? oh , i know ! madame tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum .
hi ! how are you going ?
not bad . how about you ? haven't seen you for a long time .
thanks , i like looking at photographs . how nice ! oh , i'm afraid i must be going now . i've got an appointment . have a good day .
is everything ready for the christmas party ?
i like the big star on the top of the tree . i ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food .
yes . i ’ ve bought all the things to go in it . it won ’ t take long to make . how many people are coming to the party ?
do we have christmas pudding ?
yes , i did . i send most of them a week ago . i ’ ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person .
is everything ready for billy ’ s birthday party ?
i ’ m sure of that . there ’ s enough food here to feed an army !
thanks for reminding me . i ’ ve prepared some party games for the children too .
how do you celebrate national day in your country ?
what kinds of parades are there ?
we don ’ t have a national day .
what kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ?
there ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . a lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills .
i noticed that too . what are the people learning ?
i think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future .
those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper .
hey , ray , what are you doing right now ?
yes , i do . i ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do .
hmm . i ’ ve seen that , too . we could go for a walk in the park .
i guess that ’ s out . why don ’ t we go shopping ?
ok . i guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . what do you want to do ?
i would like to , but i injured my wrist last weekend .
i don ’ t have a car .
no . do you have a car ?
oh , good . why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play mah tiang ?
not yet . i ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here .
huh ? we are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ?
hey . as long as i ’ m not alone on a saturday night , i don ’ t really care what i do !
hello mike ! would you like a drink ?
were you celebrating something ?
it ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . you should stick with one for the whole evening .

an mba , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me .
gmat ? what does that stand for and what will the test contain ?
no matter what i do , i'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat !
hi , michelle . do you need to use the photocopier ?
oh , i'm fine , thanks . i'm super busy with work actually . did you hear about the lawson contract ?
well , i was discussing the contract with bill and he said that they met the head of lawsons last week .
let ' s got out tomorrow night . we can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend .
come on ! you can just walk up to a girl and say “ if you were a booger i \ ' d pick you first . ”
fine , then you can say , “ so there you are ! i ' ve been looking all over for you , the woman of my dreams ! ”
yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink .
you want to go to the movies tonight ?
the new twilight movie !
of course it does . it ' s like a modern tale of romeo and juliet . you can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . and in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing .
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
really ?
are you excited about your trip next month ?
why ?
oh really ? i have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . it ' s not that bad though , i mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . i actually have arachnophobia .
i guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad .
well , i must confess i am a bit claustrophobic . i hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds .
the air conditioning is not working ! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
hey nick , what are you up to ?
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
wow , i didn ’ t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
what are you talking about ? let me see that . what are horoscopes ?
that ’ s bogus . i don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
let ’ s play a game !
let ’ s see . he has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok , my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh , he is also bald !
what are you doing ?
mumm . no .
what ?
i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
hey ! how was your first day of class ? i ’ m in level two and i ’ m loving my class this semester ! it ’ s great being in a class of international students !
well , i think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . you ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture .
don ’ t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice .
oh , george , what a beautiful day it is today ! the sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! what a perfect day to be at the beach ! the kids are going to have so much fun ! and we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing .
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
and stay in the shallow area . i don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier .
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy , put that down right now ! it could sting you !
oh , babe , i can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! i can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . i can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .
she what ?
four hundred ?
ah .
wow .
joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ?
what was that ?
i believe that was a wedding present to both of us , joanne . and you hardly ever use it !
whatever ! alright , i ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that i get the silver tea set .
which ones ? let me have a look . wow , look at that ! that brings back memories . that ?
. and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . i had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain .
oh , joanne , are we making a big mistake ? i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? i still love you .
woo hoo ! this just might be the start of the rest of my life !
i ’ m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . i ’ ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally . and you know i can be charming in interviews . goodbye my penniless days ! hello salary and a career !
oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
now that it ’ s the new year , i ’ ve decided to turn over a new leaf .
you got it ! i have a new job , i ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
well , first of all , i ’ ve decided to stop smoking . it ’ s not that i ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that i ’ ve been smoking since i was sixteen , and i think it ’ s time to stop .
bill . bill ! you gotta help me !
tomorrow is christmas and i haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! i ’ m such a bad son !
that ’ s just it ! i don ’ t know what to get her ! last year i got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! i suck at getting presents for people .
yeah , you ’ re right . when it comes down to it , i can be pretty tacky .
i ’ ve had it ! i ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
well , that seems easy enough .
geez . is that all ?
did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of greenwich !
what ? so you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? what game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? what are you playing ?
you ’ ve been wasting your time on this ? i can ’ t believe it ! it doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging !
fine !
hi honey ! you ’ ll never guess what ! my friends julie and alex are getting married !
i know ! anyways i just talked to alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party it ’ s gonna be so much fun ! all the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
man , i ’ m freaking out ! you gotta help me !
i can ’ t go through with this ! i just can ’ t ! i ’ m not ready for marriage ! what was i thinking ? i ’ m only thirty five years old ! i ’ ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! i can ’ t settle down yet !
i know . i know !
you ’ re right . i ’ m being crazy ! ok , i ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !
so you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ?
well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful !
i was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! then they are sold on the black market .
well , i was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! can you believe that ?
well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how kfc has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster !
oh man ! i ’ ve been starving myself for days now and i haven ’ t lost an ounce !
yeah , my friend is getting married next month and i ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . i have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but i haven ’ t lost any weight ! look at these love handles .
why ? if i eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ?
so you are saying that i should eat , but i should just watch what i eat ?
if i do all this do you think i can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ?
did you read this ? it says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family .
well , think about it . we are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
it's almost midnight ! we are about to start a brand new year !
do you have a new year's resolution ?
yeah i know what you mean . that's why this year i am keeping things more simple . maybe like getting together with friends i haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work .
what are you doing , awake ?
but it's almost midnight !
hmm . well i know that santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him !
really ! let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . that way , we can let santa do his job . then when you wake up , it will be christmas already !
look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . it says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !
well , i have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
yes , he told me . we need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference .
ah thank you ! i'm very excited . we were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . it was wonderful .
i told you already ! i ’ m going to get my nails done .
well , first of all , i like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . you should come with me !
they don ’ t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
hey michelle . good to see you . are you at lunch ?
no , i wish i was ! i just got back from spain actually .
my first time . i've traveled around europe a lot , but this was my first time to spain . it was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! no rain , and just sun , sun , sun .
ah , michelle , hi . i was hoping to see you . how have you been ? how's the family ?
i'm fine thanks . i got your report this morning . thank's for that . are you joining the conference today ?
good , well we can discuss this more then , but i think the figures are looking very good for this quarter .
so what are you doing for thanksgiving ?
well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything !
well , the first settlers of massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from england and king james . once in the new world , they befriended an native named squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn .
well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 they decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives .
come to my house for thanksgiving ! we are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing !
tom ! how are you ? we missed you at the party last night . are you ok ?
come on . we ’ ve been through this already ! look , i know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it .
yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . when i first got here , i ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . i almost let it get to me , but then i started going out , keeping myself busy and before i knew it , i was used to to it .
ok . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . i hear that an awesome dj is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !
not at all ! it be fun ! it will be like a boys ’ night out . well kinda .
this is the good life ! we have it good don ’ t you think ?
what do you mean ?
for example ?
well , i have no regrets !
did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .
you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights .
yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .
you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .
at least you ’ re doing your part . my contribution is to have a pet in the house that i treat like a member of the family .
i ’ m forming a music band .
uh . yeah ! i ’ ve told you a thousand times that i ’ m learning to play the drums . now that i know how to play well , i would like to form a rock band .
we have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . you told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house .
ok . i ’ ll talk to you later . bye
i just got off the phone with my boyfriend . he is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . it ’ s so hard to talk to him at times .
i guess you are right . what do you think i should do ? he wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know .
tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick or treating ?
of course , i did , but when i was ten ! trick or treating is for kids , plus , i ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids ncp at night .
wow , that terrible movie is finally over . next time i ’ m picking the film , because i don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick .
not everything , just this film . even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that i ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back .
i ’ m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage .
next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings .
love stories ? more like one night stands .
honey , do you have a second ?
we need to talk .
i ’ ve been thinking , and well , i think we need to start seeing other people .
that ’ s just it , i ’ m not happy anymore , tim . it ’ s not you , it ’ s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
tim , you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh , i could say that i ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . i know i ’ d only hurt you , i know i ’ d only make you cry .
hey man ! how ’ s it hanging ?
alright everyone settle down . let ’ s get started . as you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . it is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . this brings me to our topic for today . does anyone know what we celebrate on may first ?
no , that ’ s may fifth in spanish , james , no wonder you are failing my spanish class . no , may first is international workers ’ day .
no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is .
in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250 , 000 workers were involved in the may day movement . previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect .
yes ! but the happy ending came at a high price . on may third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the mccormick reaper works factory , killing four and wounding many . a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
let ’ s see . if i won the lottery , i would buy two tickets for a trip around the world .
my dad will freak out if i even mention a trip like that !
what ’ s up ? you don ’ t look too good .
i liked physics . it ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .
a physics class about the creation of the universe ? that ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . sounds more religious to me .
turtles ? whatever . look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti particles . at least , that ’ s what the math says .
there is evidence ! you know edwin hubble ? he ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . what would it be expanding from ? well , the big bang . duh !
where to , miss ?
really ? you don ’ t look very chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so .
wow sounds interesting ! excuse me if i am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?
don ’ t get me wrong ! it ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
i am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old u . s of a , although i have some colombian heritage .
uh . yeah of course !
can we talk ?
you know what i mean .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i ’ m in love with you and i need to know .
i ’ m awesome . well , i guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it .
look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ ve had our laughs , but i don ’ t appreciate . maybe it ’ s just time we .
you do ?
oh , i love you too !
mike ! what's going on , man ! long time no see !
he ’ s doing well . we went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened .
well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! he started freaking out , and screaming .
hello everyone ! i ’ m rick fields , and here with me is bob copeland .
that ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the face off . and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards !
alright , the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can ’ t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores
valerie ! hi ! wow how are you ? it ’ s been such a long time !
really ? thanks ! i went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! look at you ! you haven ’ t aged a day since the last time i saw you ! what is your secret !
yes , my little paul is finally a doctor . they grow up so fast you know .
thank you ! what about your daughter , pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
such a lovely girl . i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
same here ! we will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
i heard you were on a date last night ! so , how did it go ? i want all the juicy details !
he sounds hot ! what does he do for a living ?
hold on a sec , his name is david ?
so , did i tell you about my new year ’ s resolution ? i ’ ve decided to go on a diet .
but this time i ’ m going to stick to it . i really mean it ! trust me , carol , i ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !
who's winning ?
what ! that wasn't a foul ! c ’ mon , ref !
you were right ! he didn ’ t make the shot !
nick ! how ’ s it going ?
what are you doing in this neighbourhood ? do you live around here ?
it was great to meet you last week at the conference . i really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment .
sure , you still have my contact details , right ?
dad , i ’ d like to borrow some money .
but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example , they have 1 . 4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
i can ’ t believe that anthony is finally getting married !
don ’ t be mean . look here come the bridesmaids ! their dresses look beautiful !
that ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . oh , they look so cute !
that ’ s all you ever think about , food ! oh , i think the bride ’ s coming now ! she looks gorgeous . wait , what ’ s she doing ? where ’ s she going ?
this is the first time for me to have a chinese guest . i hope you like western cooking .
cooking is a hobby with me . i'm always trying to think up new recipes . i hope you like the soup . it's kind of a specialty of mine , so i hope you enjoy it .
thank you for your compliment . won't you try this fish with white sauce ? i'm rather round of it .
what sort of western food do you like best ?
i find the chinese dishes wonderful .
good morning , mary !
i want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . would you be able to come the next weekend on saturday ?
yes , if that's all right for you .
oh , good . if you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .
i've got some bad news about the bike you lent me .
i fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . i'm really sorry .
no , thank you .
it's kind of you to say . i feel a little stupid .
when you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway .
jane , i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , i was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
what about sunday ?
maybe next week .
sorry to hear that , i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , i really enjoyed our last chat .
i heard that ben is forming his own band .
can you play a musical instrument ? if you can , he might ask you to join the band .
i wish i could play a musical instrument . i love music .
something wrong ?
what's wrong ?
well , if you change your mind , let me know .
sure . i have all kinds of tools . just ask . i ’ ll be happy to get them for you .
anything for you . seriously , i don ’ t mind helping .
hello , kevin . i hate to do this , but i have to cancel our appointment .
yeah , i really wanted to come , too . but something unexpected in shanghai have come up . i have to fly out for a few days , but i'll be back soon .
i should have some free time next week . say , next wednesday evening ?
yeah , i'm expecting to come back on tuesday .
hi , alice , what are you doing this sunday ?
around six pm .
well , rose .
are your free this weekend ?
great , is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ?
i'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat .
is 5 pm . saturday a good time for you ?
sure , that would be great . i'll bring the wine .
yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work .
classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .
yes . that ’ s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i ’ m cooking or doing other housework .
you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . you can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .
are you ready to go to the bank ?
there ’ s problem with my bank statement . there ’ s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm .
that ’ s right . you ’ re going away next week .
i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest .
i heard that janet has got a new job . she ’ s working for the united investment group . i heard that they pay very well .
now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states .
you ’ re right . by the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ?
they did . he inherited the money from an uncle . i hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .
he said that he would probably invest most of it . he ’ s got a well paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day to day expenses . he just wants some extra money available for when he retires .
really ? have you won a fortune in the lottery ?
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
i ’ m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
hello ! let me introduce myself . my name is nancy .
no , i just started working here at ibm , i am assigned sale department .
i main market reasearch , and you ?
really ? i don't believe i would met him , is he here now ?
how do you do . i ’ m mark rancor .
may i know your name , please ?
ah , yes . i remember now . were you mr . john ’ s dinner partner last month ?
may i know what you do ?
oh , god . it ’ s late . i ’ m afraid i have to leave .
that ’ s very kind of you . but if i don ’ t go now i ’ ll miss the last bus .
thank you for your hospitality .
how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ’ ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like , i promise .
well . i really do have to go .
hi , martin . i ’ ve been looking for you all morning .
i want to say goodbye . i ’ m leaving for america tomorrow .
yes .
thank you .
me too . i ’ ll write to you once i get settled . but i have so much to do . you might have to wait a while . but i really will write to you . i love to write letters . i think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call .
i want to say goodbye to everyone .
i ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning .
you really don ’ t need to .
i hope so , too . thank you , lily . thank you for everything .
please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me .
what ’ s “ pi ” ?
i see . what is that ratio exactly ?
it ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31 . 4 centimeters .
according to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1 . 85 dollars to the pound .
what ’ s the next question .
i can help you there . those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together .
exactly . anything else ?
what ’ s the area of your country ?
that sounds quite big ! how many people live there ?
what ’ s the average income ?
so your country is fairly rich .
i really should be on my way .
no , thank you . i can ’ t .
thank you very much . i had a really good time .
ok , got it . i ’ ll call you sometime next week .
it ’ s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon .
hello , ann ! is that you ?
it's been a long time ! what's new ?
not bad i guess . i just got back from hawaii .
i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . don't let me hold you up .
ok , i won't keep you then .
yes , stay in touch . bye !
is there a lot of crime in your city ?
it ’ s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?
how would you solve the problem ?
it would probably be very expensive .
most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .
we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection .
in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food .
i went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning .
so did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon . it was raining cats and dogs .
we really have some movable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round .
what methods do you use to conserve water ?
i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
what are the seasons like in your city ?
does it ever rain in summer ?
what are spring and autumn like ?
well , i live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . we get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . in winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . summers are warm , but not hot . spring and autumn are both very short sometimes just a few weeks each . the weather is very changeable then just like spring in your city .
what's the weather like in your city ?
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ?
have you ever had snow in your city ?
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go ice skating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
what book is that ?
canada , china , and the usa are huge too .
those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all .
that looks like an interesting book .
there are the pymeids . it ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though .
look at that cylindrical office building . i ’ ve never been seen one that shape before .
tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they ’ re not perfectly cylindrical .
what sports do they play there ?
what do you do in summer ?
i don ’ t often go for walks , but i either play sports outside you know , tennis or badminton or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .
well , i play sports indoors quite often . if i ’ m feeling lazy , i just watch a film at home . i prefer summer to winter .
yes . i like wearing shorts in summer . my legs would freeze !
how do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ ve retired ?
what do you have for breakfast ?
that sounds nice . how do you spend your mornings ?
how do you spend your afternoons ?
it seems that the climate in this country is changing .
i think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment .
are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa .
what is the international community doing to help ?
how many countries have been affected ?
i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ?
yes , it is . my country is famous for having that natural resources . we also have a lot of natural gas .
no coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . we don ’ t have many metal deposits .
when i traveled around your country , i bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . the jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . the gold was found in mountain steams .
i see . that ’ s probably a good idea . too many forest are being destroyed .
does your country export a lot of natural resources ?
which resources do you have to import ?
i heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone .
if your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent .
that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
no . let me take a look . it ’ s longer than my car .
wow ! that ’ s fast ! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
which sports are popular in your country ?
do many people like tennis ?
in my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . a few people like extreme sports , but i think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them .
i know loads of people who play it regularly . there are plenty of golf courses around the country . in the past , only a tiny number of people played .
he ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long distance running ?
how are they at swimming ?
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
hi , meally , do you know that guy over there ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
helen , did you hear i ’ m having a party ? next saturday in my place .
well , drop by if you can .
lodge , you must come around sometime , you have to check out my mew stereo .
can you make it on tuesday ?
anytime after six will be fine .
does that mean i can't use it tonight ?
you didn ’ t hear ? spain won , two to zero .
i'm afraid i can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow .
not really . i'm expected to attend a meeting .
do you like snakes ?
i mean , do you like snake meat ?
it is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight .
yes . so you'd better dress warmly before you go out .
i must be going now .
now , david , can i get you a drink ? what will you have ?
which do you like better , orange or lemon ?
why ?
what would you like to do tonight ?
what about going to a movie ?
oh , here's a little token of my affection .
hello , jack . it ' s good of you to come .
thank you , jack . to be frank , i'd rather forget my birthday .
where do you spend the weekend ?
that's nice .
how about doing shopping this weekend ?
sportshoes . will you go with me ?
paul , let's go and see grandpa this afternoon .
it's saturday .
are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ?

you've formed a sound habit .
i want to have a complete relaxation this weekend .
yes , exactly .
will you go with us this sunday ?
let's go and play volleyball .
we have a live show of a football match this friday night .

i see . did they succeed in the end ?

can you name some festivals of religious nature ?
what about historic festivals ?

hi , francis .
not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart .
oh , i haven ’ t noticed that before . maybe i will try next time .
thank you . in fact , i am in a hurry . my wife is waiting for me at the parking lot .
i go to the fitness center every weekend .
to lose some weight .
are you doing something on saturday evening ? if not , welcome to my new apartment .
yes , i have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . right now , it looks like a home . i would like to have a small celebration party . please do come .
it is in the dx community , room 306 , no . 2 building . it is very easy to find . just ask the guard at the entrance .
i invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , paul . he is a very good person . you should meet him .
i am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . when would you have time ? and what kind of food do you fancy ?
to thank you for helping me at work last week . if you would not have been so kind , i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . you really did me a big favor . thank you so much .
have you signed up to join the company ’ s christmas party ?
i will . you know , as a newcomer , i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
i hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there .
will it be all right to visit you this evening ?
is this mr . smith ' s residence ?
my name is paul . is mr . smith in ?
how nice of you to come !
just fine , thanks . and you ?
good evening , mr . brown .
do you mind if we call on you this evening ?

thank you , they ’ re beautiful . you can hang your coat over there . try this new couch , it is so comfortable . you will love it . want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or cola ?
make yourself at home .
yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when i passed by this morning . so , let ’ s have a try . my treat .
good for you . today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world .
how are you making out ?
i hope so . thank you again for your delightful gift .
there will be a parade to celebrate national day this weekend .
from zhongshan circus to city bank .

april fool !
how about another beer ?
i had a wonderful evening .
oh ! i just want to drop in on him for a chat .
can we have two tickets for this evening's film ?
titanic .
front , please .
all right . we ' ll take the second row . by the way , how much is it ?
it's getting late . i'm afraid i have to leave . thank you for a most wonderful evening .
it's late . it ' s high time i left . thank you for a most wonderful evening .
good night then !
i really have a good time here . thank you very much .
welcome to my birthday party , i am so happy you can come .
thank you , shall i open it now ?
wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . i really like it . that is so nice of you .
it's getting late . i really have to go .
i hope so . a good journey to you !
i wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . they are working very hard these days . maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little .
well , what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
i'm going to have some people over for dinner saturday night . would you like to join us ?
some other time then ?
did you remember to bring back that software i lent to you ?
that ’ s ok . if you could just bring it in tomorrow , i would appreciate it .
would you mind if i make a suggestion ?
maybe you should try to quit smoking . you know it is very bad for your health .
you have made a big progress . quitting smoking is not an easy job . but it will be rewarding in the long run .
mr . keller , may i call at your home sometime the week ?
well , when will it be convenient for you ?
i'm calling about our appointment . i can't call on you this evening . my wife is terribly ill .
how about next week ?
it's hard to get tickets for the movie .
yeah , two at the tenth rows .
shall we have two tickets for for seven thirty ?
shall we go to a movie tonight ?
really ? do you like the story ? it's sheer nonsense !
everyone wants to be financial lose kill . you must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . i ’ m thinking about buying stocks . it can be a good investment if i can manage well . what do you say ?
wow , you sound very professional .
when it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ?
but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns .
shakespeare was born in 1867 .
are you sure ? can you make it more exact ?
i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?
how did that happen ?
titanic made a hit ! it was so touching .
i think we should accept his plan .
why ?
i think this one will do .
why ? what's wrong with it ?
they're very good friends , aren't they ?
jane is going to quit her job in the bank .
which season do you like best ?
what's up ? you look depressed .
would you rather i taught him a lesson for you ?
we can go to the cinema or say at home watching tv , what's it to be ?
how do mark and jones compare , in your opinion ?
may i venture to ask if you've decided to employ mark ?
do you have any plan for your future ?
many people are striving for going abroad nowadays . it seems to be a trend .
so , monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
it is not an easy job . the government is working on it . lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . but of course , it will not work overnight . so , have you come out with a new plan for today ?
good lord ! look at that man .
he's swimming in the cold sea . he must be very strong .
how have you been ?
and how's everyone in your family ?
where would you like to have your dinner ?
you don't like western food ?
how about the hiking ? it was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ?
you had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ?
hi , monica , i got big news .
not really , just take a wild guess .
well , it is not going to happen so soon , i guess .
is the bus station close by ?
i feel confused by all the diet options out there . i don ’ t know which one actually works .
maybe you ’ re right . it is very expensive to go to a weight loss center . i ’ d better join in a fitness club .
have you ever played making ?
yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
he's honest , hardworking and responsible . i simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee .
many people say it's a good story . but i think it's boring !
would you like to go skiing with me ? i heard the new ski area is great . they have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . i think it suits you best .
well , then you can go to the three day long training camp first . there ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise .
i don't think so . there ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like chinese .
i am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?
it's not good for business recently .
which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller skating ?
i've got no kite . do you have one ?
have you got any plans for the coming holiday ?
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
i wonder if you agree that money is not happiness .
then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ?
let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at mall cinema . betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and i shouldn't miss it .
no , we didn't . last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness .
oh , yeah , and i did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week . but you liked that movie , didn't you ?
it wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner . we went to an excellent restaurant .
and i don't like meat that much . the only meat i eat is chicken .
well , i suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat .
who's your favorite film star ?
what films feature him ?
which is your preference , tea or coffee ?
when did you form this hobby ?
it's easy . you only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for .
hey ! what's up ?
yeah , i've been out of town .
oh , it's getting late . i've got to run . it was nice talking to you , karren .
i guess we'll see just around .
hi , sue . what's up ?
ok , i guess . my boss has been on my back recently .
yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team .
you know how much i want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me . if i don't go to practise today . they ' ll get someone else and i'll miss my chance .
i know , and i will .
no , i won't . i'm going to skip tv tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you .
i think andy's party will be fun .
what's that ?
sure . oh , that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ?
he is not young as he looks . i think he's almost sixty .
excuse me . may i use the phone first ?
you bet . i was supposed to call my mother an hour ago .
hey , mike . can i ask you something ?
my husband is betting on france .
what do you mean ?
who is your favorite music composer ?
then you must despise such modern music as rock ?
would it be all right if i went home next weekend ?
well , i want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday .
are you sure you heard right ?
i don't believe you .
thanks a lot for having us . we had a good time .
what kind of movies do you like , sue ?
just like my wife . so , what ’ s your favorite movie ?
how about the yellow mountains ?
here , let me get the door for you .
i have some photos here taken by myself . would you like to see them ?
i would get fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty .
excuse me , are you sara wilson ?
nice to meet you too . let me help you with your bags .
do you think tom will be elected president ?
let's make a bet on who gets it .
what sort of things do you grow in your garden ?
when is your garden at its best ?
how do you think taiwan's economy is doing ?
do you know why that is ?
do you mind if i ask you to practice speaking english with me ?
well , i'm meeting some american friends next weekend .
i'm going on a cruise this summer .
my brother won a free trip and he's taking me .
but it's really too important to me .
what are you doing over the weekend , sara ?
i want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . i'm not sure i'll be able to , though .
i love ice cream .
i like both strawberry and coffee ice cream .
what do you think of shopping ?
what do you think of big department store ?
i'm sorry , i didn't quite catch that .
remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ?
he got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town .
wow , is winter always this cold in taiwan ?
no , i am from south california . this is my first real winter .
well , what brings you here ?
does she live nearby ?
hey rachael , what's up ? how is your day ?
great , so what happens now ?
how long have you been in taiwan ?
i am not sure , where exactly is it ?
so , is this your first time to taiwan ?
oh , i am so sorry .
so , karen , what do you do in your free time ?
that ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time .
hi , sandra . how was your weekend ?
fantastic ! how was that ?
i might . what did you do yesterday ?
yeah , how often do you go ?
not bad ! do you do any other sports ?
the phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
if the phoenix beats the rocket , it will enter the final .
i think i'm going to china this vacation . how about you ?
i went to france last summer .
it seems a glorious day today .
it's beginning to spot .
show us our itineraries , please .
how long will the trip take ?
they must be your parents , what do they do ?
do they often take you out ?
that's helpful for your health .
hey kevin , what are you doing here ? don't you usually spend tuesday nights at home studying ?
what did she tell them ? is she dropping out of college ?
and your parents took it badly ?
ouch , that sounds bad . what did your sister do ?
how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea .
what's the name of the series just showed ?
what a horrible name ! is it full of suspense ?
do you like watching tv ?
what do you exactly mean by usually ?
look at this headline elvis baby born on spacecraft . where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ?
it looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines .
maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food .
what's your favorite tv program ?
i also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor .
i went to visit a customer in ivs company the other day . their offices were very impressive , especially their company logo which is all over the place . there are logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . they are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table lights . it is really decorated identity .
not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .
do you take a bus to and from work ?
hmm . i have the same problem . when i leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . so the buses are always crowded .
that sounds terrible the way you describe it . but you know , not long ago i really suffered on the bus .
you just can ’ t imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full , so i waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . then i decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding !
yeah , absolutely !
you were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
you have been here for how long ? four months now ?
do you know chinese better now ?
oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain . it happens almost everywhere .
a shouting match ? you ’ re so funny . you must be exaggerating . i don ’ t believe it .
yes , perhaps . chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .
excuse me , sir , do you know what time it is ?
thank you .
yeah . i was in a hurry and i forgot my umbrella today .
oh , that ’ s very kind of you . i am going to the garden hotel .
you are married to a foreigner , huh ? so what ’ s it like ?
yeah , i know what you mean . the first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures .
oh , so he ’ s half chinese and half american . that ’ s unusual . what languages does he speak , then ?
what does he look like ? can people tell ?
i hear you're being sent to madrid for the annual conference . is that right ?
are you serious ? you haven't even been anywhere on vacation ?
well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ?
you leave next tuesday , right ? what time is your flight ?
if your flight is leaving so early , i can take you to the airport and see you off . i'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 .
is it worth seeing ?
did you see the way that brian came to work yesterday ? ever since he came back from that conference in silicon valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . it's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . i don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it .
maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties .
what's that ?
even if our company didn't have a dress code , i still think people would wear formal clothing to work .
maybe that's true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it's just not respectful to you client .
it's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
i'm really fed up with larry ! he's the biggest airhead i've ever met . he always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with .
you only say that because you don't have to work with him . the people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around . take mary for example . she ' s smart and enthusiastic . i've never met anyone as cheery as she is .
isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co worker ? what about bob ? everybody loves bob . even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co worker .
do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? or are there more issues coming into play ?
hi there , i'm steve saunders . what ' s your name ?
yes it is , better than i expected it would be . the presenters have been first rate . is this the first conference you've been to ?
i'm from long island , new york . what about yourself ?
wow . i really like california . the weather there is much better than the east coast .
just once . quite a few years ago we took the kids to disneyland on our vacation . they had a blast .
can i get you something to drink ?
about six years .
did your company go union ? i heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so it's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field .
did you hear what's going on downtown today ? all the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees .
i think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . i mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous .
for our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ?
i've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . can you make the reservation a little earlier ? if we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch .
yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort .
as along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay .
do you have the day off today ? how come you're not at work now ?
are you serious ? why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? i'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike .
the company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . did you put your name in for it ?
it's not just about the things that you learn , you know . seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . you can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . the social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway .
well , what if i told you the seminar is going to be held in hawaii ? does that perk your interest ?
the workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ?
sounds like you really learned a lot .
what did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? do you think it did much good ?
i think that's an important part of it all . we've got to be able to see another side of our co workers and boss . we can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . i really think it helped our team jell together better .
actually , i don't think so . supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . they are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . if there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . you know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play .
at their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with blycore . all the executive committee was in favor of the merger . i don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans .
is it really that simple ? it doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way .
even though the traffic is bumper to bumper out there , i don't think it's heavy traffic that makes bill late . he takes the train , remember ?
well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . he must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up .
why doesn't he just drive to work ?
so who does he think he is , anyway , i can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , i mean , it's now like he is the ceo , or anything .
yikes ! you are joking , right ? i can't believe it . no wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . i thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . what big shoes to fill !
what does a ceo do anyway ? i know the ceo makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ?
how were things in the tokyo branch when you were there ?
do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ?
why would you say that ?
i'll say ! sometimes they just do things really differently . but one thing i can say , they are really hospitable .
how can i tell her about this ?
there is no need to be so frustrated .
why are you in such a hurry ?
don't worry , do it step by step
don't worry , do it step by step .
such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today .
is that girl your girlfriend ?
she doesn't look like our classmate .
come on , tara . let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . the movie is starting in a few minutes .
i ’ m looking forward to this film . i read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper .
are these seats okay ?
how are you getting along with your wife now ?
what are you going to do then ?
that sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . if they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more .
i disagree . he was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . one should reward good service .
well , i can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance .
i know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning .
yes , but americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight .
frank , i want your advice on something . some scientists i met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . actually , they called it an informal get together .
when i asked how people were going to dress , dr . lite said it was casual .
everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . several of the women had on running shoes . i felt out of place . so i have no idea what to wear tonight .
sally , i ’ m tired of this western food . i really miss my mother ’ s sichuan cooking .
i have tried . but americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much .
it ’ s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .
thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . i was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . is that common ?
your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me .
oh , i didn't think of that . well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china . plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions .
she ’ s got quite a crowd around her . oh , look ! that little girl caught it !
hi , cindy . i thought i ’ d missed you .
it ’ s all right .
i was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
come in , come in !
i thought we were supposed to meet here .
i ’ m sorry . we must have misunderstood each other .
darling , i have news for you . bobby and his wife , evelyn , are going to have a baby soon .
actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday .
in fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is american and the other one is chinese .
it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now .
so chris , i've heard that you're from a big family . how many people ?
seven children ? that's a lot . why did your parents have so many ?
jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right .
like what ? i assume that there's no privacy .
thanks for offering to give me a lift . i ’ m looking forward to this party , but i didn ’ t want to go alone .
no , this is my first . last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale ’ s home . i took a taxi because i didn ’ t want to be late . but i was the first one
thanks for telling me this .
why are you in such a hurry ? they said , dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven fifteen . i don ’ t want to be the first one there again .
merry christmas !
i said merry christmas ! don ’ t you know that christmas is almost here ?
huh ? didn ’ t you know ? aren ’ t you excited ?
forgotten about it ? how could you ?
oh , i ’ m sorry . i didn ’ t know .
i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ?
well , would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ?
thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs .
the city is beautiful , the off . , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting .
do you mean financially rewarding ?
i ’ ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy .
how much do you make ?
hi , anna . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . where have you been ?
no wonder i haven ’ t seen you recently . where did you spend your holidays ?
you must have a wonderful time .
hi , my name is ted , what ’ s yours ?
i said , i ’ m ted , who are you ?
let ’ s go outside and talk . so laura , do you come here often ?
no , this is my first time here .
yeah , that ’ s why i ’ m here . my friends dragged me here , because they think i spend too much time studying .
anita , i ’ ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already .
do you have much experience with kids ?
to tell you the truth , sometimes i regret having a baby so early . i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby .
what about your mother ? did she help you ?
sounds not so easy to me . when that happens , i will be too old to learn .
so , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ?
you have a girlfriend in thailand ? interesting . how come i have never heard of that ?
you mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? then , how could she be your girlfriend ? maybe you don ’ t even know her .
congratulations ! it ’ s good to follow your heart . but i just didn ’ t expect to be so fast .
lili , let ’ s take a vacation !
well , lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
in the van .
let ’ s see . gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . come on . don ’ t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?
the sooner the better ! i can ’ t wait !
as long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
how is your job search going , janet ?
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !
i can ’ t wait to retire .
and then i ’ m moving to florida where i can play golf all day , every day !
what do you plan on doing after you retire ?
how good are you at sports , bill ?
wow !
well , i guess i exercise about two hours a day . i do aerobics three times a week , and the other days i play badminton 1 with my husband . i always feel good afterward .
so do you believe in palmistry ?
it's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future .
are you sure ? i've read a lot about palmistry and i've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong .
hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but .
you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you're told .
so , jack , do you believe in ghosts ?
because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost .
it was a big , green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs .
i hid so that it couldn't see me . slowly it got closer and closer , until .
what's the matter , lisa ? you don't look too good .
you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy .
two months ? how did you find out ?
so you asked him about the girl who called ?
what'd he do ?
indiscretion ? how can an indiscretion last two months ? i mean , you two have been married for two years ! how can he do that to you ?
i don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . it seems like you ’ ve got good news everyday .
all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers .
oh , i know . i saw you doing pull ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you .
it ’ s true . many students do the exercise when they have to . we have p . e . once a week .
of course . i didn ’ t know that . i only know exercise makes bodies stronger . i should take some exercise then . do you have any suggestions ?
ok , wait a minute . let's see . i'm a taurus , and it says , mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse venus . i don't know what that means , but then it says , your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . remember to be positive . sounds good to me .
don't forget my friend andy from the office . he has nothing to do on friday , so i invited him over .
why can't we ?
i'm not sure . he just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and i don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon .
i think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . it's only a superstition . it really doesn't mean anything .
ok , ok . i'll ask my sister to come . that way we'll have fourteen for dinner .
you know . like , say god is the creator of the universe , the bible , and jesus christ .
what do you believe , john ? are you christian ?
do you believe that one religion is better than another ?
how is the college search going ?
but don't you want to study music ? shouldn't it be easy ?
i know . you have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school .
i see . well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . he usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . he gave me some information , and next week i'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended .
alice , your father is amazing . he ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house .
that sounds like my grandmother . she was always stubbornly independent .
they see their independence as a kind of character strength .
i saw an interesting program on tv last night . it was about elderly people .
and the tv program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress .
so , fred , what are your plans for after graduation ?
that ’ s cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ?
i couldn ’ t even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home , then ’ d have to find my own place .
not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . my older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out .
my parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . they think that it ’ s important that i should learn how to live on my own .
hey , sandy , what's new ? interested in a movie tonight ?
soup kitchen ? is that a new restaurant or something ?
how did you get involved in something like that ?
so what do you do there ?
yeah , it sounds easy . how long does it take ?
i don't know . i mean , i like helping the community and all that , but i don't know if i have the time .
stereotypes ? like what ?
i do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . i ’ ve seen you play basketball .
you mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? that's not true at all , you're really a smart guy .
teachers ? i didn't think that they would be racist at all .
quite well . i got my ma degree two weeks ago .
come in and have some coffee , anna . the kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .
they spend hours there , especially on weekends .
i know several . but wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ?
no , it ’ s easy . we ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . they ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund .
sure . i love going to the mall .
do you hear what happened to sally ?
she passed out in class . seems she hadn't eaten anything in days .
well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . it's also society's fault magazines and ads that show thin models all saying , it's in to be thin . it's hard for them not to listen .
hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage !
yeah , you . i just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . can't you read the no littering sign ? it's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there .
because this is a public place , and i want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage .
it's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . it's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . if everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! the cleaners can't be everywhere !
hi , mr . zhang . what ’ s wrong ? you don ’ t look so happy . how was your date ?
me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are .
believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard .
hi , my name ’ s karl . my wife and i are moving in next door .
i ’ m happy to meet you . it seems everyone in town is so friendly .
well , i ’ m from chicago . there few people take the time to get to know their neighbors .
do you mind if i come along sometime ?
hey , frank . i heard you got a new job .
is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ?
so , why did you apply for such a demanding job ?
oh , i see . and can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ?
that ’ s a great employment benefit !
susan , i am inviting you and frank to our house warming party this weekend .
yes , deborah and i are going to buy a new home in woodlawn .
well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive .
that ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby .
i ’ m reading about michael milliken , the bond king .
he got arrested all right .
yup , that ’ s him . he made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless .
that ’ s the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .
hi , kate .
yeah , i saw someone walking like you , but i wasn ’ t sure . we haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now .
oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ?
wow ! that ’ s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know , old habits are hard to break .
dance ? you only go dancing ? that ’ s not hard . i can do that .
i can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in new york city .
why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live .
what do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ?
you're becoming a real television watcher .
i enjoy watching channel 5 . they always have films from all over the world .
i can read the subtitles . my set is a huge screen one .
will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? my family will be happy to see you . and father misses you very much .
yes , i turned it off when the fight got heated in it .
do you have any plan on your mind ?
how are we going there , by bike or by bus ?
a lecture on how to make stir fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like .
what channel did you watch last night ?
you did ? how do you like the fashion show ?
what do you plan to do for your birthday ?
how about a party at home ? that way we can get together and celebrate it .
did you watch the live telecast of the world cup last night ?
what's the band called ?
mom , you know that andrea and i sometimes worry about you .
you ’ re almost 70 years old , mom ! don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?
do you ever get lonely living alone ?
so kim , have you ever had anything stolen ?
my uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . i was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days .
he did . it was one of the best ones available . but that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . and on a crowded street too .
you would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . no one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . the thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away .
do you have any idea for this vacation ?
have you ever thought of going to africa ?
would you like to go with me ?
are you a wrestler or a boxer ?
hey , what's the matter ?
what's your favorite kind of music ? do you like pop music ?
i like it , too . but sometimes i enjoy jazz and classical music .
i don't think i'm getting better .
your muscles are a spectacle !
no , but i am starting working out from now on .
what's your weight ?
do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat .
do you remember tina , my good friend ?
she just broke up with her boyfriend .
but the problem is she and her ex boyfriend are working in the same department . it is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday .
shall we go downtown for a movie this friday evening ?
how many people are there in your family ?
is your brother older or younger than you ?
great party , isn ’ t it ?
by the way , my name is liu wei .
what do you do , susan ?
i work for the bank of china , in the international section .
hello 。 this is susan .
yes , i think so .
what ’ s the time ?
oh , i ’ m sorry i can ’ t . because i have to do some housework . you can ask jenny to go with you .
is the chinese team taking the lead ?
japanese teams always play a dark horse .
what are the most popular sports in your country ?
jogging and bowling . do you know how to practise bungfu ?
is it easy to learn ?
thank you . i can teach you how to bowl .
can you tell the result ?
now the score is in our favor .
hard to say . now the score is in our favor .
what's the score ?
the russian team needs to tie the ukraine to get the pass for the final .
do you like a package tour or to travel alone ?
well , it ’ s really too late . i have to go now .
sorry , i can ’ t . my mother doesn ’ t want me to be late . i really have to go .
have you ever been to any other country ?
that's also my dream .
anything interesting in this city ?
it's worth the time .
what kind of job have you ever had ?
i'm really tired of my job in the bank . i'm thinking about changing it .
not yet , what's your opinion ?
are you getting overtime ?
have you thought about another job ?
i've booked an air ticket to venice .
i'd like to stay there for a week .
what does he look like ? is he handsome ?
i like hitchhiking . will you go with me ?
it's a pity . say , how about a place near enough ?
new england .
your father looks much younger in the picture .
what a brilliant smile !
he must be very easy going .
what shall i call him ?
what's he doing ?
is this your brother in law ?
i like this kind of weather .
and it's calm . i like the peace .
fairly warm this morning , isn't it ?
say , how about a walk along the river ?
no , i'd like to go alone .
what did you do last vacation ?
what will you do this vacation ?
say , do you go to see your grandparents often ?
oh , yes , you like skiing .
bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ?
so let's get registered tomorrow .
this man is your fiance , dolly ?
is this a photo of your family ?
you look so lovely .
the sun is shining .
that's the sign of wind .
what does your mother do , may i ask ?
is she busy ?
who's that old lady trimming the trees ?
she's looks very healthy . how old is she ?
tomorrow will be fine too , i think .
what lovely weather !
let's go out and enjoy the fresh air .
this is my uncle , charles .
which team has won ?
but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized .
i think he deserved his gold .
yes , it's perfect !
look ! it's clearing up .
i like summer as long as it's bright like this .
daddy , i want to buy a ten speed sportsman .
no , i'm not asking for money . i'm asking for your advice .
is your father in the habit of having naps ?
don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ?
i want to go to china for sight seeing . what do you think of it , mum ?
will you go with me , too ?
i mean her personality .
whose part do you think is best played ?
you're absolutely right ! that's the very figure i like best .
how do you like other films starring charlie chaplin ?
you don't like the performance , do you ?
did you enjoy the movie ?
a new film is on . have you ever seen it ?
it's a feature film .
i've had enough of that !
i hate the hero . he ' s too cruel .
i plan to buy a car this year .
i'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments .
going to the cafeteria ?
that ’ s fine with me . i don ’ t hate vegetables and i don ’ t eat much during lunch .
how was your education going on in australia ?
where are you going to work then , in australia or back in china ?
why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad .
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .
don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ?
did they mutiny ?
mary , how was your date with john ?
oh , really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
i heard through the grapevine that michael probably become the new sales manager .
i am not a rumor monger .
i am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?
actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision .
let's go to the new club on west street .
should we ask jason to play ? he's always watching movies on hbo .
oh , come on ! the game is better with three people . anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
hi , francis , how was your business trip ?
what ’ s up ?
sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
this is really a sad story . did they trace back your luggage ?
the new computer software is driving me crazy ! i really need a break !
that ’ s what i ’ ve heard . but as far as i ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . can you pass the sugar , please ?
did you see the information on sales for last year ? the sales review was made at our last board meeting . there's a great news for our shareholders .
we've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . we have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . our strategy is working !
spring festival is the most important festival in china , isn't it ?
how long is the holiday ?
do you eat any special food for the festival ?
that's interesting . i'm told the chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ?
oh , great ! i hope i can spend this spring festival with you here in beijing .
i've got an idea . let's make this game even more interesting .
well , if you want to ! seriously , though , let's make a bet .
is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
do you mind if we watch it . i ’ d really like to see it .
football game ? ok , and you know what comes on next ?
are you interested in watching it ?
oh , i am sorry . what's on channel 2 at 10 pm ?
do you want to watch it ?
jason , it's your turn .
you rolled a four . let's see . you landed on foreign films .
well , too bad . so , what foreign film won an oscar in 1993 ?
great ! i landed on classic movies .
i love them , especially the all time greats like gone with the wind .
ok , comeback kid . here's you last question . how many times did robin williams win the oscar for best actor ?
i suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ?
i think sound is even more important ! guns , bombs , sirens that's what makes a movie exciting !
in my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up .
i can't believe it ! i lost .
that's not fair , you got all the easy questions .
i want a rematch . let's play again .
ok , nick . here's the question , what movie and its sequel both won an oscar for best picture ?
all right , let's see who's ruining my tv time .
is your boss named vic ? your pager says , this is vic . here i come !
here , see for yourself . that's really strange ! it's almost the same as when i .
what's wrong ? you don't like ancient egypt ?
the pyramids are amazing ! millions of gigantic stones . each one perfect .
what upsets you ?
it is not your mother finding one for you ?
perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type .
no , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . i know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . you can be face to face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes .
i think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so called love at first sight .
don ’ t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications .
i'll tell you something that's good about action movies . the special effects are great !
well , did you know he was also the director of the terminator ?
doris , helen mall is having a big sale this weekend . do you wanna go ?
i never watch foreign films . they're too boring .
hey , it is ! a lot of people like that movie !
face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob .
how's your new job going ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
would you rather have her or your old boss back ?
how about your new co workers ?
do you miss your old co workers ?
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
do you like working in teams with people from different departments ?
do you like working in teams ?
hi , my name's abby . what's your name ?
i'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what kind of job are you looking for ?
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
not if you are good at net working . do you like to meet new people ?
do you have experience in the it field ?
that's ok . have you sent your cv out to anyone yet ?
did you write a clear objective in your resume ?
ok . i'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . what about you , nick ?
why not ! i rolled a five . the category is best pictures .
i know that , it's the english patient . it was one of the only good american movies of the 90s .
how did your interview go ?
if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ?
will you get a pay raise , too ?
that makes sense . who interviewed you ?
what kinds of questions did she ask you ?
the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . what did you tell her ?
those are good answers . how did she react ?
what do you think about her as a boss ?
you're lucky . not everyone has such a great boss !
hi , ellen . that outfit looks terrific !
no , we just don ’ t usually admit it !
jack ! do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
well , this is my new baby . he ’ s just as much trouble . that ’ s for sure ! but , he ’ s a lot of fun !
hi , alex . how are you doing ?
i know the feeling . i ’ m calling to let you know about this new italian place i found . it ’ s right around the corner .
melissa ? i ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party .
her birthday is on the 9th . we ’ re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing .
you're right italian ! ha ! ha ! i was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it !
i could give you a few pointers if you want . i know a lot about coffee .
i'm robert , at your service .
i ’ m sorry to hear about that . why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? it ’ ll be good for you !
my buddha ! ! it's beautiful ! but i thought you were afraid ?
you sneak !
well , the way you drive , jen . i still don't think that's a good idea .
i know . it's a mix of all the latest songs .
no . i recorded these from your cds .
ok , dead man . if this doesn't start your engine , nothing will .
no , i don't .
espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . it's strong .
if you want something manly , stick with the espresso .
i think you're being a little naive .
that proves my point ! protect yourself or you'll get burned .
who got ripped off ?
well , maybe not 100 percent . i did hear about some tricks people use .
there are shills . a shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale .
i'm the coolest high tech stud around .
not yet . i got an mp3 player and a set of stereo headphones .
three other people started to bid . one called himself buddhabuyer , so i knew he meant business . i raised my bid twice , but it kept going up .
i don't know . i dropped out at $ 250 .
what does this have to do with me ?
order tea . isn't that what you like to drink ?
if you want to be macho , order a double shot of espresso .
i'm more worried about snipers .
sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price .
i heard about a software program called turbid . it automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction .
i have something really cool to tell you about ! do you know anything about online auctions ?
they're awesome ! i was browsing through the ebay auction today , and i found the cutest fat little copper buddha ! it's over a hundred years old .
why not ?
nope . i'm going to tell your fortune . so . the oilier , the better .
it's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! it's magical .
yeah . just pull on this strip . then peel off the back .
if they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends .
yeah . but it's fun . look at those two ugly old ladies . or are they men ?
look , the aliens are sending a message to mulder . this rocks !
you have a pager ? ! that's a little high tech for you , stu . are you sure you know how to use it ?
you're so witty .
this watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand .
it's better for right handed people like me . see , i don't even have to move my arm to see the time .
be a little more open minded , stu ! don't believe everything you read in your history books !
what are you hiding in your coat pocket ?
you want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ?
what's that supposed to mean ?
michael johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful .
what are you talking about ? ! he ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken !
just because ben johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are .
hey , look ! they ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 olympics .
he completed the first 200 / 400 double in olympic history !
carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 .
are you ready for the big competition today , todd ? the winner gets two tickets to the sydney olympics !
anyone home ? jen !
wow ! you're really working up a storm !
what's the matter with you , paul ?
looks like it . you need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
do you have cold medicine ?
no , i don't .
i have a headache . is there anything i can buy without a prescription ?
i will take the aspirin then . and have you a small first aid kit ?
i'll take it too .
you look pale , paul . what ' s wrong ?
i'm sorry to hear that . anything i can do for you ?
i can't even imagine you snorkeling !
ok , bond .
so you can always keep two times at once ?
you didn't come to work yesterday . what happened ?
what's wrong with him ?
is he getting better now ?
i heard you've found a new job .
so you're quite happy with your new job ?
mine's 20/20 . life just isn't fair , is it ?
what do you mean ?
they don't have toilets at the campground ?
i know you love the oscars . this game has some great questions about all types of movies .
isabelle , you know i'm not interested in fame .
you know i'm interested in teaching . i'm looking for jazz students .
i know they're out there . i'll find them .
yeah , it's really cute . but why a monkey suit ? is hello kitty having an identity complex ?
you were born in the year of the monkey ?
are you ready for the camping trip ?
hello ! we're supposed to be getting back to nature .
i've been packed for a week . all my stuff is in this backpack .
that's trail mix !
my disposable contact lenses . they're great for camping !
yep . they're prescription contacts with uv protection .
you just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . no cleaning !
you look very professional in the suit .
i met a girl in elevator this morning . she works in a company upstairs . she said she envied the casual way we dress for work . she complained about the dress rule in her company . it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday .
you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?
i will . you know , as a newcomer , i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere .
i hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there .
thank you , shall i open it now ?
wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . i really like it . that is so nice of you .
yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when i passed by this morning . so , let ’ s have a try . my treat .
good for you . today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world .
i am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . when would you have time ? and what kind of food do you fancy ?
to thank you for helping me at work last week . if you would not have been so kind , i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . you really did me a big favor . thank you so much .
fine , i know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . shall we try that one ?
have you heard that we will have reorganization ?
yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
james is going to be packed off there .
i heard that james was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender .
come on in . i am so glad you are here . we have been expecting you .
no , you are just on time . we haven ’ t really started yet .
thank you , they ’ re beautiful . you can hang your coat over there . try this new couch , it is so comfortable . you will love it . want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or cola ?
make yourself at home .
are you doing something on saturday evening ? if not , welcome to my new apartment .
yes , i have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . right now , it looks like a home . i would like to have a small celebration party . please do come .
it is in the dx community , room 306 , no . 2 building . it is very easy to find . just ask the guard at the entrance .
i invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , paul . he is a very good person . you should meet him .
any idea about james ? he ’ s a pain in the neck .
oh , is that so ?
i am thinking about resigning from my current job .
yes , i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
yes , i will move on to xyz company .
hi , lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ?
sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . people may think you are telling them how to do their work . if they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work .
you are quite right . thank you for sharing your experience with me . i learned a lot .
i am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . we just made a record sale this season .
it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
i am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ?
the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don ’ t know what to do first .
actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision .
congratulations ! i heard that you are going to take a two week training course in the headquarter .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
well , good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
is the view going to be ok ?
i ’ ll do my best .
did you sign up for the picnic party ?
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
have you ever been to xi ’ an ?
i ’ ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . i really want to see the old walls and terra cotta warriors one day . of course i won ’ t miss the local food either . you know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
sure it is . is it convenient to get there by plane ?
i wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . they are working very hard these days . maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little .
well , what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ?
lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ?
what about the environmental factors ?
who wants to go first ? allen ?
ok . put on something by the backstreet boys !
it ’ s hard to commute a long way .
how are you feeling , champ ? ready to go ?
in what ?
can you do the vault ?
did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ?
well , usually people think i'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say i sound a lot better !
here we are , ryan ! this is where we're going to celebrate !
you won't need it . stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody !
if it were up to stanley , we'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing .
i don't know . i think you might be over the hill .
mountain biking is an olympic sport ?
how do i look in this new dress ?
how about this one ?
thanks for the pizza . it was delicious .
next time , it's on me .
i'm serious .
certainly . the vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . it must be very delicious .
i remember you said that you like china because it has cheap beers .
why do you drink ? i mean , where does drinking get you ?
come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity .
how ? by drinking ?
when did you begin to drink ?
and then ?
who is it ?
you're always so careless .
okay , but i haven't prepare supper .
what do you want to eat ?
it's a beautiful sport , isn't it ?
sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
are you ready , honey ?
just dress formal .
it is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner .
i prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for ice cream .
you are really career minded .
have you ever played making ?
yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master .
so , monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ?
that ’ s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
it is not an easy job . the government is working on it . lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . but of course , it will not work overnight . so , have you come out with a new plan for today ?
you didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . what ’ s up ?
but you still look a little bit tired . what time did you leave ?
that ’ s normal after a tense work evening . working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . once , i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later .
volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ?
it must be a unique experience . i ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back .
how about the hiking ? it was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ?
you had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ?
a friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . he told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . he recommended me to subscribe to it . what do you say ?
well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance .
look at this survey conducted by a website . a quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . hi , francis , what about you ?
though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , i don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that .
but it is lucky for us . the company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . i have shopped too often online these days .
how long have you been in this company ?
you must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college .
well , you ’ ve adapted yourself very well . everyone in our office thinks you ’ ve made a great progress in the past two years . what is your secret ?
do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?
an average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that .
i bought it . i got a watch , too . the company that sells this car has a car club .
yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car !
i know girls love this kind of car . look , it's got a sunroof ! imagine . a cool , starry night .
and lots of dear abby sob stories .
no wonder you're such a wacko .
are you ready to go shopping ?
what research ?
but they're just ads .
you changed jobs again ? why do you move so frequently ?
why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ?
office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .
yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .
gross ! what are you doing to yourself ?
it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball !
i think i need a new notebook .
you bet there is . feast your eyes on this puppy !
believe it !
uh . that's greek to me .
well , mine are baggy . they're the kind of pants you can lounge around in .
so maybe we shouldn't go out after all .
just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear .
that's madame psychic to you .
you know , mary , i feel we meet somewhere before . where were you born ?
what was your childhood like ?
where did you go to university ?
what is your current occupation ?
indeed , i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably , i should put on car key and simple shirt .
have you heard anything about markweed inc . ? they have called me back for interview , and i'm considering taking a job with them .
the best . huh ? with so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ?
really ? what about the pay rate ? are the wages pretty high ?
well , what about the work environment ? not every one is motivated solely by money .
no , i borrowed it .
i wonder what he looks like . oh , i can't wait to see him ! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat . oh , there he is .
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
that way they look longer .
putting on mascara .
i won't .
i wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when susan resigned last week to work for the sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them .
well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , i know sunburst is suffering from inbreeding .
with susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board .
do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ?
i guess i need all of them .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
jen , it's not alive . but it does look user friendly .
did you meet the new girl in our sales department . she is taking the place of maggie during her alternative leave .
i guess not , they haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday .
any plans tonight ?
well , i am wondering if we took a hang out for a drink or something . you know , i just came back from a really tough interview . i was quite nervous during the interview . i really want to have the job . right now , i am still a little on the edge . i am not sure if i could convince them during the interview .
i don ’ t know . i think i did well in the paper exams . i was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as i expected . to my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the chinese poesy with me .
have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , i think it is not reasonable . what if there are some important calls ?
i am totally fed up with my boss . he has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . this time i am really going to report him for sexual harassment .
he constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . i doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment .
you ’ re missing the point . it ’ s about respect . he treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co workers . it ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words .
hi , tina , i ’ ve got good news . i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company . they informed me to go to the final round next monday . it looks very promising .
thanks . let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . are you free ?
i have made up my mind . i am getting a tattoo .
yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back .
really ?
oh , i didn ’ t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
i've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . you always give such amazing presentations , i was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow .
what kind of visuals should i use to support the presentation ? do you think i should use powerpoint ?
i think i can put something together , no problem . but when it comes to tomorrow , i'll just be a bundle of nerves ! how can i get over my fear of speaking in public ?
hi , francis .
oh , i haven ’ t noticed that before . maybe i will try next time .
if only our company prescribe flex time .
good news . ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
manchester united . what about you ?
could you please get me a takeaway ? i have some urgent work to finish . so i don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch .
what do you mean ?
what do you think his strengths are ?
it's amazing to me how international business has become . take my store for example . on any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves .
china provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . we import more than 40 different items from china . most of the imports that come out of china are low grade plastics or toys . japan produces many electronic exports , germany produces excellent mechanical exports .
i am really tired of terry .
what's the news on our website ? how effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ?
what kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ?
you really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information . what about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ?
earning extra income on the internet is easier than you might think . after i started selling traditional craft items on the internet last year , i have really been able to make bank doing something i love .
to run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . you've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular .
after you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . if you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with .
i think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . the government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy .
well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but i think it's backfired . the immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise .
fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . you can leave this job to jason .
but what ?
did you hear what happened in the scott case ? some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . now every newspapers is all over it .
i'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details .
i'm sure there'll be canned ! and there also might be some legal consequences .
because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality .
the new webpage design is much more effective than before . i feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user friendly format .
the old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . now it's different . we got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing .
first , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . they can sign up for a free monthly drawing . once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . we also added a specific area for on line customer service . so far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback .
here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . there are about forty or so that are hot . you should contact them immediately , in the next twenty four hours if you can . the rest are categorized according to potential and interest . you can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack .
don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . we've just got to make sure the hot ones are contacted right away . and even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . we've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . i don't want our investment to go down the drain .
it's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed . the trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , i really think we're headed for a recession .
increasing exports would weaken the currency . i think the main point is economic growth . we need more jobs . factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . if more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
did you hear the news ? two of our major suppliers , murphy music and u tunes are merging ! if they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy .
i read it myself on the financial page . they ' re really going to join together . u tunes was bought out by murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month .
i heard a rumor this morning . it seems trusten tools is going out of business . another competitor is going bankrupt . that could be good news for us .
what ? we are merging with trusten ? i never thought that would happen . will we be getting new owners ? will it affect our jobs ?
wow , with such a big change . we won't have the same name ?
how many people are there in your family ?
that is a big family . how old is your sister ?
what about your brother ?
do you miss your family ?
do you often go home ?
how often do you write to them ?
i really should be on my way .
no , thanks all the same .
thank you very much . we really had a good time .
not bad . at least i am still alive .
where did you get that idea ?
you are right . i am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent .
good morning , mr . black . i am the new secretary .
i don't want to make a bad impression .
i'll keep that in mind . does everything on the desk belong to me ?
what's the extension number for my phone ?
can i make personal phone calls during my office hours ?
i understand .
hi , ann . i was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ?
i've just gotten a pair of pre sale star wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . are you interested ?
my pleasure .
a friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . he was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece .
not really . considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . besides , i knew you were really looking forward to watching star wars on the opening day .
well , let's see . the movie stars at 10 . we should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . i could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you .
okay .
yeah , that's great . i'll see you tomorrow night .
what is the weather like today ?
and the streets are covered with ice . do you know what the temperature is today ?
it seems 10 degree below zero at least . i don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery .
hi , helen ! how is it going ?
well , take it easy ! don't let it get on top of you .
why don't you take a few days off ?
how about having a cup of tea with us ?
oh , do you go hiking often ?
it would be nice to get out of the city . do you want some company ?
yeah , i go a lot too . i saw a bear and a lion on my last hike .
yeah , my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
hello , tony . fancy meeting you here . how are things going with you ?
pretty good ! how are your parents these days ?
oh , good . that's nice to hear . well , i am going to a football match . i need to go .
hi , maggy , did you hear about david ?
you know , about david and new boss .
well , i hear david have been fired .
what is the correct time , please ?
when will you lecture begin ?
oh my god ! it's 10:00 pm . i have to go .
i am afraid not .
thank you . well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in .
did you lock the doors ?
well , i ’ m going on to bed . i ’ m beat .
please told tim to close the door to the basement . i don ’ t want dog down there tonight .
would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ?
what would you like to see in beijing ?
do you like traveling ?
where did you visit ?
how did you like it ?
where did you go there .
you must enjoy yourself .
could you tell me the right time , please ?
you have to go and fix it .
may i introduce myself ? i am steven smith .
great party , isn't it ?
this is my first , i only met jane last week . she and i teach at the same school .
yeah , history , what about you ?
salesman ?
oh , i see , by the way , my name's mary .
good afternoon , would you mind if i sat here ?
i ’ m jack . what ’ s your name ?
do you like this place ?
do you like swimming ?
i just dropped in to say goodbye .
i ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock .
did you go to see michael last night ?
weren ’ t you frightened ?
would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ?
but why ? since you like it so much .
well , i must be off now . i have an appointment at six .
ok , goodbye .
it ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ?
thank you for coming to see me off .
if i have time , i will come again .
thank you for your hospitality . i hope i didn ’ t cause you too much trouble during my stay .
i ’ m afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon .
good morning , jerry . how ' s everything ?
doing anything for lunch ?
well . what ’ s the climate like in your country ?
which season do you like best ?
the whether in beijing is just beautiful .
yes . i can see . the summer heat is over . and the winter cold is still far away .
autumn is also very nice in washington .
no . it isn ’ t . but sometimes it slows a lot in winter .
oh . yes . sometimes it rains very heavily
that ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here .
guess , what i ’ ve bought for you .
how nice it is here
i ’ ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year
i ’ d better be going .
i wish i could , but it ’ s already late .
thank you for wonderful meat .
merry christmas !
are you doing anything special ?

i am not sure , where exactly is it ?

not bad ! do you do any other sports ?
helen , did you hear i ’ m having a party ? next saturday in my place .
hi , emily , do you know that guy over there ?
he is cute . what dose he do ?
really ? are you going to introduce us ?
i am having a hard time at my job .
but i don't know what else i can do . i am willing to work hard . sometimes i make mistakes and the boss is not happy .
tell that to my boss .
yes .
he was also assassinated because of his views .
well , if he can become president , then i can at least get a promotion .
so , how's your work ?
i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries .
but we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done .
that's why i am going to leave .
i am worried about my future . i can't believe that our company is as big as it is . the company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff .
let's take a coffee break , shall we ?
what keeps you so busy ? you've been sitting there for hours . you've got to walk around . you just can't stay on the computer forever .
do you have any tissue , eve ? i've used all mine .
thanks . i am all right . it's just my nose . it must be an allergy . do you have any aspirin ? i have a terrible headache .
no , no . i am okay . it's the weather . it was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining .
i can't . i am already behind the schedule . besides , you know mr . white . he would think that i was putting him on .
do i ? oh , no .
what about mr . white ?
you look tired .
really ? how come ?
you shouldn't work so hard .
what do you mean ?
shall i punch out for you , ross ? i am leaving now .
but today is friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening , are you ?
no . we ’ ll meet at my house . he invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa .
it's not his villa , but his father's . i think it's somewhere in florida . i am not sure myself .
come on . you just haven ’ t met the right person and i think that you work too much . you should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life .
well , suit yourself . i've got to run now .
you too . oh , i forgot to tell you one thing . a girl called this afternoon . she said she was your ex girlfriend . she wanted you to call her back .
no , nothing else . see you monday .
did you see may today ?
i don't have the foggiest idea .
yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently .
now it's a question of getting there . i need a flight to paris on sunday evening and a hotel in paris for 3 nights . i have to be in frankfurt by 11 on thursday morning . and i will need a hotel for one night . i will head home on friday .
my last appointment is at 3 , so i should be free by 5 at the very latest . i think i could get to the airport by 6 .
you are a pessimist .
hey rachael , what's up ? how is your day ?
oh , yea . i forgot . so how did it go ?
great , so what happens now ?
so vicky , how long have you held your present position ?
and how do you like working for ibm ?
what ’ s strength do you bring to the job ?
you must be wily . it's nice to meet you .
tim , please . please be seated .
so , wily , you have been with ibm for two years ready for change ?
you are friend of janet , right ? i am andrew , andrew smith .
i'm sorry , i didn't quite catch that .
lodge , you must come around sometime , you have to check out my mew stereo .
can you make it on tuesday ?
anytime after six will be fine .
hello . this is susan .
oh , i ’ m sorry i can ’ t because i have to do some housework . you can ask jenny to go with you
how many people are there in your family ?
is your brother older or younger than you ?
great party , isn ’ t it ?
what do you do , susan ?
where do you come from ?
do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ?
do you mind if i read your newspaper for a while ?
excuse me , can you tell me where i can take a taxi ? this is the first time i have been in england , so i don't know where i can do at all .
all right . i only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way .
thanks a lot , bye bye .
hello , green here .
i'll be please to if i can . what can i do for you ?
good , where are you now ?
oh , well , that's just a few minutes walk to my office , come around and see me now .
i'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?
which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?
ok . i'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
see you later .
hello !
hi , jason ! long time no see . how's the hotel ?
i know what you mean .
i am leaving in two weeks .
oh , i am sorry , jason . i've already got plans for friday evening . how about saturday ?
7 is fine with me .
nice to meet you here . how come you dropped into this company today ?
two years or so .
no , in most cases i don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . i work five days a week .
luckily not . the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
hey , jack ! is jenny coming with us ?
well , i don't have the guts to ask her out .
i ’ d totally die if she turned me down .
long time no see !
that's nice . where have you been ?
are you busy now ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
well , i came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common .
so i think i may fall in love with her .
then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ?
that's what i did .
yes .
thanks . but i know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another .
yeah . falling in love is so good !
hi , mike . haven't seen you for a while . how's cathy ?
what happened ? did you break up ?
oh , i am sorry . maybe you were just emotional at that moment . do you think you guys can get back together ?
has alan shown up yet ?
i wonder what happened .
last week his sister was admitted to the hospital .
his sister had a car accident last week .
she is still in a coma .
how's your mother doing ?
that's too bad . i wish your mother can recover soon .
the world changes , the family changes too .
people now like a small family composed of two parents and one child .
i don't like such a family .
i like a family composed of many people . it includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children .
gino , do you really need to go ?
but don't forget to give me a ring .
why don't you read the local newspaper ?
new york times is better ?
do you like music ?
do you think the music is well matched ?
i like it . naturally it can arouse your feelings .
did you have any hobbies ?
what kind of books do you like to read most ?
are you in love ?
people say only those that are in love like to read romance stories .
you mean sweet heart .
what do you think about cold wind ?
so no . 4 is your favorite . which one don't you like ?
why ?
can we have two tickets for seven thirty ?
what do you like best about it ?
so what did you think about the movie ?
really ? i don't agree . this star wars episode was incredible !
well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . state of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and i don't think they will be disappointed .
i know exactly what you mean . hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling .
do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ?
well , maybe . but i like the little kid who played manakin skywalker . i can't imagine anyone else playing that role .
i've no idea . but looking at the success of star wars episode , i've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . i hope it will be even better than this one .
well , i think we should go now . it's getting pretty late .
here is the song list .
yes , here you are .
let me play it for you .
it's very easy . here it is . ready ? excellent ! you are a good singer . you sing the bass so well .
i'll sing a chinese folk song love song of hanging , first in chinese then in english .
look ! there are playing the matrix today .
i don't know . if we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers .
come on . we are already here . besides , i really wanna see this picture .
seven thirty . there is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line !
yeah , let's do so .
what can you expect with this crowd ? i am praying that no one will cut in the line .
merry christmas , lily .
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
as we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .
what's your hobby ?
what's the make of your camera ?
do you own your own darkroom ?
why ?
oh , no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion .
money is no object .
i will take ten .
happy new year !
have you got any plans ?
she told me she'd be here .
are you rushing me ?
i know what i am doing . don't worry . can you do me a favor ?
take care of pamela when i am away . she is a nice girl . i don't want her to get hurt or anything .
thank you . now i see that you are my true friend . most of my so called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . you are the only one who has stood by me the whole time .
thank you for being a friend of mine .
the bridegroom looks a bit nervous .
oh , they are playing the wedding march . here they come .
i am so happy for them .
yes , i always cry at weddings .
yes , they are .
in fact , we are beginning to make preparations .
no , no , for the engagement .
well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking .
but what are the sources of water pollution ?
well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ?
but what about the indirect ones ?
i see . for the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it .
look at these newlyweds . they seem as if they are on top of the world .
people who have just got married feel that the world is right before them .
i can't bear you anymore . i am sick of your drinking . i am divorcing you .
how many chances should i give you ? i've given up on you !
are you a happy married man ?
you are a lucky man . how about mr . smith .
you mean she bosses her husband around ?
i hear jean married a business tycoon .
but i don't think she really loves him .
the blacks got divorced .
mr . black has been getting a little on the side .
no . the only thing i've ever done behind your back is zipping you up .
hi , mike . we're having a party tonight , wanna come join us ? you can bring your girlfriend .
what happened ? did you have a fight ?
yeah , she is . she is pretty , caring , getting easy going and she is a great cook . she is a gem .
so , when are you going to tell her ?
i know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . she will be badly hurt !
hi , is that david ?
hey , what's new ?
sorry to hear that . what happened ?
hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? the girl i saw with jack yesterday .
hey , she is not worth it . forget her .
but you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face .
the one where you look like your dog just died . you have to get over her and the sooner the better .
are you coming to the bridal shower for jane ?
aug 8 .
mrs . white .
maybe her uncle will .
right . red rochester will officiate at the wedding .
i heard you are going out with john ?
why ? are you kidding me ? a guy like that is hard to find . few boys are so caring , so patient , and did i mention he is hottie ?
totally . i am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! and it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too .
hey , jenny . would you like to go to dinner with me ?
no , i don't . what do they say about office romances ?
that's silly . what i do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here .
people fall in love with people they work with . that's a fact .
if it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other .
good grief . all i did was ask you out . i am sorry .
i am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime .
i like company .
what can i say ? i am a passionate guy .
you want to go out with me and you know it .
i'd like to meet you again sometime .
i hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian .
where is she going to college ?
why do you look so gloomy ? what are you looking for ?
did you finish typing yesterday ?
don't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ?
how about the shelf ?
don't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go .
cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh , what's this ? is this your dissertation ?
you ’ ve put it among these journals .
you have a lovely house , jack .
that's too bad . what problems are you having .
i ’ ve studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
tom , did you see the film last night ?
do you really think so ? i don't think so . it wasn't that bad film at all . didn't you hear the applause of the audience ?
please allow me to introduce myself . my name is tom .
yes , i did . have you lived here long ?
i am an accountant at a company
ms anderson , my name is mike . i am division chief of abc company . welcome to toronto .
a pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .
if you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . it's extremely bad for your health , you know .
well , i've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . it may give you a feeling to reduce it .
you look run down , brian .
well , you wanna take a sick leave ? all you need now is a good , long rest .
please do excuse me for a moment . i've got diarrhea .
it may have something to do with the food i had last night
steve , you look pale . what happened ?
did you have something on your mind ? you look so concerned . maybe i can help you .
is there anything i can do to help you ?
hi , robert . what happened to your face ? it looks swollen .
did it hurt ?
how long were you in the chair ?
don't you have a dental insurance ?
yeah . it won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old .
let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it .
did he give you any advice ?
hi , john ! how was your vacation ?
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
wow , isn't that dangerous ?
tell me about it .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
hey , mike . you've been surfing the net for quite a while . what on earth are you searching for ?
well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff .
you can say that .
they must have mixed hackers with crackers .
there is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . they break into computers and break the phone system . real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them .
well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . this irritates real hackers to no end .
you got it .
what's the mountaineering club doing this weekend ?
what did you do last week ?
wow . that sounds like a lot of fun . i am sorry i missed it .
yeah , i will . see you then !
no . just want to relax a little bit . you don't have to win the lottery to relax , do you ?
come on . it's on me .
don't be silly . i'll take you anywhere you wanna go .
it's a perfect day for swimming .
great ! i love swimming . besides , i need a tan for hill ’ s party
aren ’ t you going to swim ?
you are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ?
what about your beautiful bathing suit ? we shopped all day . don't you want to show it off ?
all right . suit yourself . i am going swimming .
yes ?
i've got a better idea . why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? what do you think ?
did you go camping last saturday ?
what kind of books do you like ?
i prefer the novels by hemingway , such as the old man and the sea . i like the simple words in his novels .
but it's already awfully close .
i guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then .
so how did you meet bill ?
oh , really ? which bulletin board ?
i've heard about that , but i've never tried it .
i have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers .
i just want a private conversation with one other person .
well , maybe i'll tag along and watch how you talk .
it ’ s that popular ?
wow ! you look like a drowned rat ! didn't you know there is a thunder storm today ?
well . you'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold .
yes , it is . the sun is shining . there is no wind , only a pleasant breeze .
we have decided to go to the park this sunday . would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ?
he ’ s predicting clear skies .
what a lovely day , isn't it ?
is the weather usually like this here ?
what's the weather like in winter ?
i wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow .
neither too cold , nor too hot .
once , when i was a child .
now and then .
how do you do ?
it ’ s nice to meet you , mr . stevens .
did you hear how cold it got last night ?
it was so cold this morning . i could hardly start my car .
don't you have a garage ?
does it ever get that cold on here ?
lousy weather , isn't it ?
her dress looks funny .
are you kidding she is behind the times . that style went out last year .
well , you ’ re really as out dated as she is .
do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ?
why not ? why can't we go back to the way things were ?
darned right i would !
come on , liz . be open minded ! look at my eyes , they are puffy . and my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . i really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings .
they are professors and government officials .
most of them are from america and europe .
they are attending an international conference here .
look how fast that car can accelerate !
how ’ s the food ?
well i don ’ t think so . i don ’ t like it at all !
i eat dog food when my parents are out .
poor us ! all this junk food lacks nutrition !
robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ?
and later ?
lizzy smith .
yes .
oh , not bad . then do you know her mother ?
that sounds terrific .
what ’ s wrong with you , mr . polly ?
then , buy a bottle of soft drink .
it ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now .
yeah , those classics from the great writers .
hi , how is it going ?
that ’ s right . i ’ ve never really liked it since i got here .
and i ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy .
don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . that , that makes it worse .
you don ’ t love me ?
but we ’ re so right for each other .
actually , i'm not good at tennis at all .
oh , come on . that's no reason to do something you're not interested in .
how about the classical music club ?
hey how about the cinema club ?
have you ever made any plan for your future ?
not me . i'd like to be a bachelor forever .
did you see victor on wednesday , wendy ?
wasn ’ t it cold on wednesday ?
it ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods .
it sounds wonderful . did you take lunch with you ?
excuse me , you look familiar . did you use to live in new york ?
did you use to work at nyu ?
oh , did you know hugh young ? he was a music student .
yes . and he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university .
oh , no . he ’ s an executive for a large computer company . i saw an interview with him on tv yesterday . they were asking his opinion about future uses for computers .
what ’ s on tv tonight ?
wait a second . i want to watch ally mcneal .
no it ’ s not . it ’ s just funny .
well , you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl .
it ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
you look so tan and healthy !
how was it ?
like what ?
i ’ m so jealous .
television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ?
aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things . best programmes that . that undoubtedly are on television ?
do you think though that . that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er . sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
hello , james . come in . go through to the living room .
do you like my carpet ? be honest ! tell me what you really think .
you really should stop smoking , you know .
how many cigarettes do you smoke a day ?
wow . you ’ re really a heavy smoker .
he died of lung cancer , right ?
when the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is .
and this bedroom is too big and damp . but it ’ s better than a tent .
what ’ s wrong with it ?
guess what !
i am going to the mountains with my family this weekend .
we're going out to dinner and then to the movies .
don't worry . i've got money . it's my treat .
don't you have too much to do with him .
his father is a prisoner .
would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ?
how long have you been in china ?
how do you think of living here ?
do you know how to play go ?
but i heard it is very difficult to play .
well , i ’ ve been going to athletic express , but i don ’ t like it there .
the people don ’ t really work out there . they just stand around and talk all the time .
yeah , is your club different ?
do they have a lot of equipment ?
sounds nice . what about classes ?
really ? thanks . i ’ ll stop by when i get off work .
hey john , nice skates . are they new ?
yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . i play goalie , myself .
the rockets .
believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide .
that's what i'm wondering , too .
yes , but he was supposed to be back by now .

what musical instrument do you play ?
then we can have one more program at our party ?
i can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding .
and all of the flowers are in bloom .
there's a game on tonight . you want to watch it with me ?

next time you see him , please tell him i'm thinking of him .

i saw emily yesterday evening . she was wearing a cd evening gown . she told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 !

five .

then you've got to try it . let's go to the skating rink on thursday .
friday then . how about it ?
i just saw something about mary last night . it was hilarious .
what do you mean sick ? it was really funny , don't you think ?
why not ?
it wasn't a dirty movie . there wasn't even any nudity .
oh , you are too conservative . it's just realistic .
i'd love to continue this conversation , but i really need to go now . i have to get back to the office .

true . well , see you tomorrow .
hey , john . nice car .
what is this , the new ford ?

yeah , sure .
i ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here .
i ’ m doing great , thank you .
susan ? what brings you here today ?

don ’ t worry . i ’ m getting more sleep these days . the baby ’ s finally growing up a little more .
well , what a nice day !
but it was not at all so fine yesterday .
did it ?
i was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing .
maybe . i see some dark clouds moving in .
it'll be dusty , too , i guess .
why is that ?
then what about spring ?
it must be cold in the winter , though .
thanks for reminding me .
excuse me . do you study chinese at this university ?
yes , i am . i am from guangzhou . i am here to study international relations .
hey , there ’ s leo . i wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman .
hey , karen . look like you got some sun this weekend .
that ’ s great . where did you stay ?
not to mention cooler . did you go swimming ?
it all sounds so relaxing . i wish i could get away to the beach like that .
what ?
nothing
yes , i am .
i don ’ t actually know him .
i only know him through the . you are not gonna believe this .
yes .
so dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .
so i ’ ve got two tickets to the latest show but i need a little favor from you .
so what kind of music turns you on ?
you mean the kind of stuff like nirvana ?
excuse me , are you dr . smith ?
i'm david , joanna's husband . she has to be at work late today . so she asked me to pick you up here .
well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . what about you ?
julie , is that you ?
yes , it's me . and you're julie ashley . how are you ?
excuse me , sir , may i have the time , please ?
er . i'd like to know what time it is now .
thank you . by the way , what day is today ?
yes , i've just come from the states , yesterday in fact . i'm still a bit confused about the time .
who is this on the water buffalo ?
that's interesting . go on !
so he became a self taught man ?
in what field ?
is he still in that that type of work .
he has lots of hobbies .
he ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses .
he lets his cousins look after his business .
i ’ ll sing you a song .
most of my songs are sad , sorry .
let ’ s go to the seashore on saturday .
it ’ s expensive , too . let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead .
thank you , linda . we would love you to come to our wedding .
at nine sharp .
sheila , what time should we meet tomorrow ?
what place ?
and what should i wear ?
what are you going to wear ?
sheila , how about that fashionable blue dress ?
hello , ellen .
oh , no ! what happened ?
how awful ! was he hurt ?
how did it happen ?
how horrible !
hello , lily .
when i come late , there ’ s usually nothing left .
is this your umbrella , miss ?
you look a bit familiar to me . i wonder if i have seen you somewhere before .
that ’ s it . i live there , too . i live on the sixth floor .
it ’ s a small world ! may i know your name , miss ?
how do you do , miss chen ? i ’ m song mei .
are the children all grown up now , rose ?
really ? and chris ? she was a very pretty little girl .
really ? where does he live now ?
and does rocky drive a truck , too ?
really ? where does he fly ? does he fly to other countries ?
can my friend , tom mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ?
mm — hmm . you met him last summer . he is small and very smart .
you know what , last night i almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor .
luckily that was nothing serious .
elaine ’ s back from school . i think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . i suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ?
how do you know ? you haven ’ t seen her since high school . i guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .
i guess i ’ ll just have to tell mr . robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing god knows what . god don ’ t go on like this . if you absolutely refuse to take her out .
and we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof .
nothing ?
you and patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? you can tell me .
come on .
how many passengers are there aboard the ship ?
are these your triplets ? they ’ re beautiful ! i ’ ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . you know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and john ! are you planning on having any more ?
well , tell me . how was the labor and delivery ?
i can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting .
i know i ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . i almost got killed on the chair lift ! this is going to be so embarrassing .
this is only your second time skiing . this is definitely a case of the blind leading the blind .
i don ’ t think i can get up enough nerve to do this .
no ! ! !
labor is an abundant resource here .
this paper absorbs water so quickly !
hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? i ’ m starving .
dad and mom ?
hi , mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ?
i see . then what about tomorrow , at starbucks ?
we thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal .
betty and i will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come .
sure . we ’ ll be looking forward to that day .
so do you think i can take it ?
what do you say we stop in at that burger king over there and grab a bite ?
yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . hey ! how about that one over there ?
easy . it ’ s on me .
like to come over to our fancy dress party ?
well , then join us some other time .
don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship dolphin ?
so you ’ ve got something on your mind , i guess .
well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you .
out of hand .
where ’ d you meet him ?
about what ?
excuse me ?
looks like a good party , i probably know about half the people .
where ?
how do you do ? i ’ m parker .
parker .
yes , with a p .
barker ? with a b . of course .
won ’ t you come in , mr . barker ?
he ’ s got laid off again . i do feel sorry for him .
do you see the woman ? is she a teacher ?
does she teach chinese ?
and who ’ s the man in the green beside her ?
what ’ s the matter , sally ? you look so unhappy .
what happened ?
what ’ s the date today ?
right . what present should we give him this time ? by the way , how old is he ?
how time flies ! he ’ s a big boy now .
hi , bill .
where is that cool guy , dick ? i haven ’ t seen him for two weeks .
bummer , i ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ?
i'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
my accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year .
yes , i ’ m feeling very well these days .
and i was glad to receive your letter .
i will be back again next wednesday .
do you think i should buy this now and bring it with us ?
what kind of gas does this car take ?
i will give you premium unleaded . alright ?
that is the pump you are in front of .
it is the most expensive .
yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little .
are you still working day and night ?
hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! my name is rick fields and of course , i am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , bob copeland .
well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . it ’ s time to play ball !
a very nice curve ball by the pitcher . the catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and vargas gets a line drive !
great play !
hey , ted . what are you up to this friday ?
that ’ s great ! do you have any plans ?
sounds nice .
can i stop by ?
we have to pick up conrad before the party .
we're supposed to meet him at cal's bar at 10
yes .
yes , it is . conrad is gay . didn't you know ?
why should he do that ? it isn't illegal for us to go in .
you sound like you're afraid .
you've never been in a gay bar before ?
but it's just a bar . there's no danger . you shouldn't be so homophobic .
listen . if you refuse to go in , conrad will be offended . you don't hate gay people , do you ?
don't worry about it . there is nothing strange about it . if conrad's there , we'll leave for the party . if he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink .
i'm glad you feel that way . we ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ?
you're late .
my phone ?
really ? i had no idea . let me check . yes , it's dead . there's no dial tone .
you know what . the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play . they are supposed to call me this evening . if i don't have a phone . oh , what can i do ?
do you have a cell phone ?
can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it isn't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number . she will let us wait in her living room .
yes , i do . at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line . if they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here . but if not , i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild . it ' s very important to me .
did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business !
what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ?
geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that .
bill . bill ! you gotta help me !
tomorrow is christmas and i haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! i ’ m such a bad son !
yeah , you ’ re right . when it comes down to it , i can be pretty tacky .
honey , do you have a second ?
i ’ ve been thinking , and well , i think we need to start seeing other people .
i can ’ t , tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i ’ m only doing this for you . i don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do .
joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ?
what was that ?
let ’ s not go there , joanne ! ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , i ’ ll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back .
i believe that was a wedding present to both of us , joanne . and you hardly ever use it !
whatever ! alright , i ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that i get the silver tea set .
which ones ? let me have a look . wow , look at that ! that brings back memories . that ?
. and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . i had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain .
oh , joanne , are we making a big mistake ? i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? i still love you .
that was a great dinner . i didn't know that you knew how yo cook .
ooh , that's my favorite . maybe i'll have a small slice .
i'll have a cup of tea .
actually , could i have some milk with that ?
skim , please . that'd be very nice . thanks . oh no . janna , i'm so sorry , but i've got to go .
i just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up .
she's on the m40 , near reading .
i don't know , she didn't say . i'm so sorry about this .
actually , i've only got a two seater . i'll have to go on my own .
are your ready to go to the supermarket ?
i've got my money and my keys , so i'm ready .
it wasn't cold out this morning .
well , i guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well .
it does , actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
ok . i'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it's a bit chilly in here .
i don't know . the weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
i don't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
if i'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me .
what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
that doesn't sound pretty .
well , i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
i suppose i should . i don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
that sounds like fun .
hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ?
well , wish him a happy birthday for me .
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
sorry , i've got people coming over tomorrow night .
yeah , me , too . it's about time i made a move .
what are you listening to ? is that beethoven or mozart ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . do you believe that ?
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
to be honest , i think classical music is too complicated for me .
i like pop music . do you ?
i see what you mean . i think that's way i like it so much .
i've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
so , how did you become interested in it ?
do you still play piano ?
it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead .
what did the critic say ?
the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready .
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ?
i like those kinds of programmes too . they ’ re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv .
yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational !
in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour .
no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ?
some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes .
what ’ s the plot of your new movie ?
did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director .
critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ ve made recently . does that bother you ?
did you do you own stunts in the movie ?
thank you very much for doing this interview .
what did you do over the weekend ?
do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?
i had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !
have you ever been in an earthquake ?
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
no , but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
i'm from the plains of the midwest . it's a prime location for tornadoes .
most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
what happened to him ?
was it his first offence ?
what happened to him then ?
did they take his license away ?
what do you think will happen to him ?
that doesn't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ?
my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him .
which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ?
it would probably be very expensive .
it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
most voters what everything both ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes .
first , i ’ ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
how do you research your books ?
i really like your books . i ’ ve just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
oh ! thank you very much . i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . what are the stories about ?
i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans .
i love being photographed ! if i were famous , i ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle .
no one really believes gossip columnists .
i love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity .
you ’ re a big fan of andy lau , aren ’ t you ?
how come you don ’ t have all of his films on dvd ?
i see . i ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him .
are you a member of his fan club ?
did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
i think that show biz stars have a really easy life . they have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they ’ re famous , so everyone loves them .
i bet they love it really . sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?
no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don ’ t even pay for drin
guess what ? i've got great news !
well , you know how i've been working at the economist as a proof reader , right ?
well , the editor in chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back .
it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
yes , but i'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
i don't have any with me , but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
me , too . do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight . how about you ?
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
i ‘ m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
you might think this strange , but i like the category for best foreign language film .
i love history , but i ’ ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
some people say that history repeats itself .
the idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
london is such a historic city ! there ’ s history everywhere you look . there ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . he won the battle of
nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of boadicea . she fought the romans when they invaded britain .
she was a very controversial leader . are we going to visit the famous tower of london later ?
i ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . i really want to see the crown jewels too .
where ’ s that ? oh , i know ! madame tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum .
are you an art aficionado ?
i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
art isn ’ t for everyone . i ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
i thought i ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there .
the art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . he says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned .
i liked it . i didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion .
i like landscapes and still life . you prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ?
i agree . i prefer oils too . i collect landscapes , but i only have a small collection . you have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ?
that would be nice . can you read the characters ?
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?
do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?
i think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but i don't think it always makes sense .
i do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but i don't for higher end items .
it's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it .
do you have any plans for tomorrow night ?
sure . what movies were you thinking about going to ?
yes . isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed shaun of the dead ?
i was thinking of seeing you , me and dupree . it's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
yeah , i suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?
it depends on who the film is about . which movie did you have in mind ?
that sounds fantastic ! what time is it playing ?
great . shall i meet you there around 7 forty five tomorrow night ?
so , have you seen all three the lord of the rings movies ?
that's the return of the king , right ?
i thought the special effects were amazing , but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me .
no . did you ?
yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .
most movies are . another problem for me was the film was dubbed in german with english subtitles .
i heard that the return of the king was nominated for 11 oscars .
hi , come on in . can i take your coat ?
you're the first guest to arrive . i'll just put your coat away and then i'll get you something to drink .
whatever you prefer .
just over three weeks . would you like a drink ?
i've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .
one glass of red wine coming up !
there's just going to be 6 of us tonight .
marcia and paul called to cancel at the last moment . paul was running late and marcia wasn't feeling well .
yes , i do . i ’ m learning chinese now on the internet .
it ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good .
actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they ’ re easy for me .
yes . how are the spanish classes going ?
let ’ s play a game !
no , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !
let ’ s see . he has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok , my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh , he is also bald !
those are today ’ s top stories . now let ’ s go to john for the weather . john , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ?
that ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! will it rain on saturday ?
is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ?
we should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs .
great ! i asked grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers .
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
wow , i didn ’ t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
oh , man . i had the best supper last night . my wife made a stir fry and it was amazing !
well , you can keep the vegetables , i ’ ll take the meat . the stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion .
those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with mike sanderson .
not a great week for the world ! any good news ?
nah ! let ’ s go get a burger and fries .
what are you talking about ? i have salads some times .
fine ! i ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . are you happy now ?
did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of greenwich !
hey lydia , what are you reading ?
what are you talking about ? let me see that . what are horoscopes ?
january 5th .
that ’ s bogus . i don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ?
what are you doing ?
what ?
i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl .
sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me .
all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me !
you got it ! i have a new job , i ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life .
well , first of all , i ’ ve decided to stop smoking . it ’ s not that i ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that i ’ ve been smoking since i was sixteen , and i think it ’ s time to stop .
one last thing , i ’ ve decided to come out of the closet .
hey . why did you take that money ? you are such a cheater ! i should send you to jail !
well you can ’ t just take the money . you have to ask the bank for money . and i ’ m the banker .
yes .
nice day today , isn't it ?
we can't complain about the weather recently .
i wonder how long this weather can last .
any rain ?
hello , john . how are you ?
fine , thanks . i've been busy lately .
i've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month .
where are you going now ?
i can't . i have to meet someone .
oh , george , what a beautiful day it is today ! the sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! what a perfect day to be at the beach ! the kids are going to have so much fun ! a
there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect .
what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy , put that down right now ! it could sting you !
oh look ! what a great little bib for the baby ! this will definitely come in handy ! oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! that ’ s so great ! thank you !
a highchair and car seat ! wow betty , thank you so much ! i really appreciate it !
a playpen and crib ! thanks carla ! this is just what i needed !
i've come to say goodbye .
my mother in law just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight .
doctors aren't sure yet . but the real problem is suzy . she has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . but we don't know who can stay with her .
yes , i'd ask jill , the girl i've had before , but i need someone overnight . maybe even for two nights .
i don't want to do that to you , karen .
your own kids would get suzy's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i don't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days .
i'd like to talk with her . this is short notice , i know . but hank and i are leaving tonight .
i'm glad you know someone . i knew you would be the best person to ask about this . i don't want to insult jill or her mother . i think jill maybe could do it . but i'd rather have someone a little older .
what are we going to do ? i can't get the car out of this ditch . i'm stuck !
i know . this is terrible . what can we do ? this snow doesn't stop falling !
i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half hour to go .
i don't know .
what do you mean ?
i have plenty of gas .
so what can we do ?
days ?
oh , my god ! it's good we have food .
hi . what's up ?
not too much . i've been pretty busy .
gotta go . call me tonight .
good morning golf aficionados ! my name is rick fields , and you guessed it , i am here with my main man , bob copeland .
whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! let ’ s go to the course and see how tiger woods is doing .
it seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . he is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .
there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio .
it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area .
no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here . this is what is called a tornado watch . that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado .
yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming . so it's called a watch .
yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning . so if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere .
well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true . if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement .
that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they're very loud .
maybe . it depends on the tornado . some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour . that is very fast . others aren't so fast .
i've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend's house . so i quickly called them on the phone .
they were all sitting in the living room watching tv . they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house . if it had hit them , they could have all been killed .
well , kristin did give me a hand with the slides . she ' s a real wiz on powerpoint .
yeah , well , that was some good advice . you made some really good points .
the owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot
i think i might move in with my parents for a couple of months until i can find something . you know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . i ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while .
actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ?
hey there , you look a little lost . are you new here ?
you can always spot the newbies . i can give you a few pointers if you want . were you trying to use this machine here ?
it ’ s ok , i know how it is . this machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
i ’ m forming a music band .
uh . yeah ! i ’ ve told you a thousand times that i ’ m learning to play the drums . now that i know how to play well , i would like to form a rock band .
we have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . you told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house .
this is the good life ! we have it good don ’ t you think ?
what do you mean ?
for example ?
i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally .
well , i have no regrets !
mark . where have you been ? i ’ ve been calling you all morning .
what ? so you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? what game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? what are you playing ?
you ’ ve been wasting your time on this ? i can ’ t believe it ! it doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging !
fine !
you ’ ll never guess what ! my friends julie and alex are getting married !
i know ! anyways i just talked to alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party it ’ s gonna be so much fun ! all the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .
aw come on ! it ’ s just some innocent fun ! you know how these things are ! we are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . nothing too over the top .
come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
okay , next question . if eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ?
let ’ s see . if i won the lottery , i would buy two tickets for a trip around the world .
my dad will freak out if i even mention a trip like that !
you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights .
yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings .
you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching .
bobby ! come here , look what i got you !
a chess board ! daddy is going to teach you how to play !
ok , each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ’ ll play with the black pieces . now in the front , you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .
see this one that looks like a tower ? it ’ s called the rook . the one with the tall hat is called the bishop . see this little horsey ? this is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .
hey man ! how ’ s it hanging ?
did you go to the roller rink on saturday ? i heard it was far out , man !
right on , right on ! well , jim went to the rink with sherry and he said it was dy no mite ! he was low on bread , but sherry paid for everything .
can we talk ?
you know what i mean .
i ’ m awesome . well , i guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it .
look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ ve had our laughs , but i don ’ t appreciate . maybe it ’ s just time we .
you do ?
oh , i love you too !
welcome back movie lovers to another premier movie review . my name is richard clarke and i am joined today by the very erudite davidwatson .
well , i think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries . the musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .
open your heart dick . don ’ t shut us out .
where to , miss ?
sure thing . so , where are you flying in from ?
really ? you don ’ t look very chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so .
wow sounds interesting ! excuse me if i am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?
don ’ t get me wrong ! it ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !
i am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old u . s of a , although i have some colombian heritage .
. and now , let ’ s go to kenny williams for today ’ s weather forecast .
what ’ s the weather looking like today , kenny ?
it ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! what about tomorrow kenny ? do you have good news for us ?
it ’ s a beautiful day here in new zealand at the men ’ s volleyball world championship . my name is rick fields and i ’ m joined by the man with the plan , bob copeland .
hey , you ’ re early ! where ’ s everyone ?
oh . why ?
sure . what is it ?
are you serious ? we ’ ve been friends for years ! we can ’ t just change that overnight !
excuse me . can you tell me how to get started using these machines ?
yes .
nice to meet you .
yes , i know that . derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room . so i'm ready , i think . i can start using the machines .
what do you mean a membership card ? i already have one .
i'm ready .
i see . so this card helps me to keep track of my progress .
alright . great .
great . why don't we start on the machines ?
i'm sorry . i know there are still seven machines . but i'm exhausted .
what can i do though ? i don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines .
i think i'm going to go home .
i know , but it's 12
three or four o'clock ?
i never stay out that late . that's too late .
were you so wild when you were still in taipei , sharon ?
what is that they're doing on the couch ?
pot ? isn't that marijuana ?
but , sharon , that's illegal ! the police could come , and we could go to jail .
really ?
i didn't know you had such wild friends . do you smoke marijuana too ?
i don't want to .
i don't know if i can drink more . i already had two drinks .
i'm going over to the gym . i want to do some running .
are you kidding ? do you know how cold it is today ?
no , it's not . not at all . i'd probably freeze my lungs .
you ?
i didn't know you could exercise .
you're going to lift weights ? hah !
i'm sorry . i just can't imagine you lifting weights .
it's true . if a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish . that ' s why i keep running . even in the winter .
but lifting weights isn't the best thing . you should do some kind of aerobic exercise .
it sounds like a good plan to me . i'm still . i mean .
i am kind of nervous .
i don't know . i never went to a church before . i was not raised as a christian , so i don't know what to do .
maybe . i know i agreed to go with you , but now i don't feel right about it .
really ?
alright . but will we sing ?
i don't know the words .
and will i go up to the front to have the bread and wine ?
eu char ist ? what is that ?
it doesn't sound like an english word .
alright . well , i feel more comfortable now . now i understand i am welcome as a visitor .
karen , do you have a minute ? i'd like to ask you about something .
i think you can give me some advice . you have worked here longer , and i just want to know what you think .
i am worried about the meeting this morning .
really ?
i'm afraid i was too rude .
well , i maybe talked to mr . drummond too directly . i thought i maybe said too much . i don't want him to be angry .
really ?
but i am new here , and i'm not sure he is used to that .
yes . and he is the president of the company .
i am very happy to hear that , karen . it ' s good to know i'm working in such a company .
good . thank you for telling me this .
excuse me . is anyone in that seat next to you ?
do you mind if i put my jacket there ?
yes . and you ?
well , there are many chinese americans , you know . and your english is very good . you sound like an american .
no , really . i can only hear a little accent .
well , yes . actually , i'm going back to visit .
no , i'm going back to america to visit . i'm from america , but i don't live there now . i live in taichung .
yes . why not ?
sure . i teach history in a university . have you heard of dong hai university ?
i have lived in taichung for two years now . so this is the second time i am going back to states . i go back once a year to visit my family .
no , it isn't strange at all . many people from taiwan move to america too , you know . do you think it is strange for them ?
so it looks like we start selling in the u . s . next year .
he's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an american . but even if he hires an american , i'll probably be transferred to our american office .
we aren't sure yet . maybe l . a . i think l . a . would be the best idea .
yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything . now we have the right to sell in america at a much lower tariff . it ' s going to be good . we can compete more directly with them .
our computers have a high level of quality now . we can demonstrate it . and our prices will be good . so i think it will really be worthwhile .
well , you know i studied marketing in america . so maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . i'd love to be part of the team .
yes , i do . i think we can compete . i think we can make a name for ourselves . it will be hard at first . but if we develop a good advertising campaign , i think we can break into the market .
it takes some time . because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name . name recognition is crucial .
that's very nice of you to say . but if we set up an office there in the states , maybe you could try to become part of it .
ok . bye !
alright . see ya !
ok , see you after school .
mom ?
there are some things i miss . but i love chinese food . and i think the people in taiwan are really hospitable . besides , i grew up in los angeles , so i'm used to living in crowded places . why are you going to america ?
why ?
don't worry about it . your sister lives there . she probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go . it ' s true there are some dangerous places in big american cities . but if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already .
the museums are excellent . and the shopping ! well ! i'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there .
isn ’ t this great ? i always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food !
that ’ s fine ! don ’ t worry about it !
relax , it was just a goat !
it ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . we can milk them later .
did you read this ? it says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family .
well , think about it . we are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to .
we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary .
what ’ s the point ? we always make a new year ’ s resolution and by february we will have forgotten about it . it ’ s pointless .
what about you ? your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in .
man , i ’ m freaking out ! you gotta help me !
i can ’ t go through with this ! i just can ’ t ! i ’ m not ready for marriage ! what was i thinking ? i ’ m only thirty five years old ! i ’ ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! i can ’ t settle down yet !
i know . i know !
you ’ re right . i ’ m being crazy ! ok , i ’ m ready , let ’ s do this !
come on . we ’ ve been through this already ! look , i know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it .
yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . when i first got here , i ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . i almost let it get to me , but then i started going out , keeping myself busy and before i knew it , i was used to to it .
ok . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . i hear that an awesome dj is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there !
not at all ! it be fun ! it will be like a boys ’ night out . well kinda .
her ex boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse !
tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick or treating ?
of course , i did , but when i was ten ! trick or treating is for kids , plus , i ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids ncp at night .
wow , american football is more exciting than i thought .
oh , right . so , i can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on . who ’ s winning ?
wow ! what a hit !
is he ok ?
i guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team .
yeah .
what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ?
wow ! i can ’ t believe i ’ m standing here !
i ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art !
i ’ ve seen it so many times in books , but i never imagined i ’ d get to see it in person .
maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ?
about 80 million dollars .
here ’ s your hot dog and beer . what happened ? did i miss anything ?
what ’ s the score ?
so baltimore is winning ?
this is a really great place to watch a baseball game .
the fans are great here , too . not like in philadelphia .
oh .
all right !
wow , michael jordan ’ s slam dunks are beautiful things to watch .
which team do you think will win ?
what ’ s the mountaineering club doing this weekend ?
how hard is the climb ?
what did you do last week ?
wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i ’ m sorry i missed it .
yeah , i will . see you then !
hi , john , how was your vacation ?
that must have been wonderful . do anything interesting ?
tell me about it .
500 feet ! i would never be able to do that .
hey man , what do you have on tap ?
sure ! let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks .
have any plans for the weekend , tom ?
oh , do you go hiking often ?
yeah , i go a lot too . i saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
yeah , my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
hey , tom , what to go for a run ?
i try to do that , but i can ’ t get up early enough .
it ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; i ’ d rather run in the morning .
i could try , but i can ’ t say for sure if i ’ ll get up in time . what time do you want to go ?
o . k . , maybe if i have someone to go with , i ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog .
welcome back , soccer fans . my name is rick fields and , as always , i am joined by my commentating wingman , bob copeland .
the ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds .
no question about it . he was offside by a mile ! we have a goal kick for ecuador . edison mendez heads it to valencia , he shoots ! deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick .
thank god you showed up when you did ! he ’ s insane ! do you think we should call the police ?
i know ! well . he said i ’ m not pregnant . i ’ m sorry if i got you all worked up over nothing . i want you to know that i didn ’ t do it on purpose .
just hold me . i ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . and together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . i believe in us , steven .
. the rings please . may this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end .
honey , that ’ s my pinkie . the ring goes on the ring finger !
that ’ s my index finger !
umm . that ’ s the thumb , nick .
we ’ ve been over this a thousand times . the data is irrefutable ! look , we ’ ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory !
that is preposterous !
hello everyone ! i ’ m rick fields , and here with me is bob copeland .
alright , the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can ’ t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores .
i found a new job after all , and i like this one even better than the last .
would you travel around the world if you had the money ?
do you think you will ever work at that company again ?
that was a tough question . how did you get it right ?
all of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and i'm going too !
how was your business trip ?
i never understand why these shops have so much liquor .
but why ? why don't people like to buy shirts duty free ? or shoes ? i just don't understand why it's always liquor .
no , i didn't . how high is the tax ?
why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?
that's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ?
will you be at the family reunion next year ?
hectic . it's always hectic . but how was your windsurfing ?
see ? i told you . it's very hard .
fifty times ?
and how much did it cost to rent it ?
well , that's not too bad then .
this place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ?
what are you planning to do today ?
have you done windsurfing before ?
can you take a little advice from a friend ?
don't waste your money . windsurfing is very hard . and it will be windy today . they will charge you fifty dollars for a half hour , and you won't be able to windsurf . you will fall and fall and fall .
yes , but it takes a long time to learn . you would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer .
you are too picky .
which guy ?
oh , i see him now . wait ! that's .
oh , wow ! it's really him ! who is that woman he's with ?
i can't do that .
i don't want to lose all my money .
i guess you're right .
yes , i remember . you must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play .
i know it's true , sandy . but still some people lose control . they start to gamble , and they can't stop .
maybe 500 dollars .
i don't want people to think i'm stingy .
now i understand . but i don't smoke or drink . so what am i supposed to buy in here ?
no , i'm sorry . i don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes . it is kind of disgusting .
who knows ? hey , i like these jade bears here .
yes , but she would like this a lot . she likes to collect little things like this .
so how much should i gamble ?
okay . one hundred then . do you think i will lose it ?
i want games that are all luck .
slot machines ? no , i don't want that ! that's too boring . i want a game with cards or dice .
blackjack . we can play blackjack . and i will gamble one hundred , or maybe two hundred dollars .
oh , don't be so strict ! we are in las vegas .
. so , i said , let ’ s take a break . and since that night , i ’ ve been waiting for him to call , but i still haven ’ t heard from him . you don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ?
you think so ? oh , no ! how can he do this to me ? i ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! why else wouldn ’ t he call ?
he ’ s the love of my life ! i ’ ve really messed this up .
but i . i still love him ! and it ’ s all my fault ! i can ’ t believe how immature and selfish i was being . i mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . i ’ ve totally messed this up !
no , this is not gonna happen ! i . i ’ ve ruined everything .
why did she do that ?
irene ! i heard you were on a date last night ! so , how how did it go ? i want all the juicy details !
okay , now you really have to fill me in . what ’ s he like ?
he sounds hot ! what does he do for a living ?
hold on a sec , his name is david ?
i ’ m so excited about chinese new year ! when do i get to visit grandma ? grandma makes the best dumplings in the world !
i was scared because . because i saw a bug . that ’ s all .
oh , and i can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! dad , can i sit on your shoulders this time ?
has the game started yet ?
who's winning ?
what ! that wasn't a foul ! c ’ mon , ref !
you were right ! he didn ’ t make the shot !
did you see that ? he traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !
i ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! i feel just awful about this whole thing . i wanna make it up to you . let me take you out to dinner tonight . my treat .
perfect !
me too . you look so beautiful tonight ! i wish this night would never end . there ’ s something i have to tell you .
so , did i tell you about my new year ’ s resolution ? i ’ ve decided to go on a diet .
exactly ! i ’ m going to cut out all that junk i eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food .
but this time i ’ m going to stick to it . i really mean it ! trust me , carol , i ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time !
don ’ t be mean . look here come the bridesmaids ! their dresses look beautiful !
that ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . oh , they look so cute !
whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? watch out !
oh , no ! i ’ m so sorry ! are you all right ?
i feel terrible , i really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . my tire , just exploded , and i lost control of my bike . really , it was an accident . please accept my apologies .
yeah , i think we have met somewhere before . that ’ s right ! we met at aaron ’ s place last weekend ! what a coincidence ! but anyway , i ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and i should probably get going . i have a nine o ’ clock meeting .
what do you want to do tomorrow night ?
it's friday . we should go party .
okay . stay home sunday . but friday we should go out dancing .
yes ? why not ?
they aren't alcoholic !
so where should we go ?
you always want to go to the latin club . i don't know those dance steps . i'd rather go to the new bar .
it's not all techno music . it's not a special techno night .
it's fine with me if we go to the latin club . i like latin music . the only thing i never want to do again is listen to country rock . what was that bar called ?
yes . you have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do .
nick ! how ’ s it going ?
what are you doing in this neighbourhood ? do you live around here ?
it was great to meet you last week at the conference . i really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment .
sure , you still have my contact details , right ?
what were the schools like ?
but you taught children , yes ?
they actually study after school ?
hmm . that sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . don't they ever relax ?
asian cultures value learning very much . i know that .
but aren't the kids tired out ? i mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too .
are the kids in taiwan very obedient ?
hmm . i know you taught in costa rica also . which did you like better costa rica or taiwan ?
how did you get around over there ? did you rent cars ?
i've heard about enrail passes . so those europeans really depend on trains a lot .
it's too bad for the environment . so much pollution from cars .
yes , i agree . i think it is a cultural characteristic . it would be very hard to get us americans to change this . but you know what ? probably , in the future , americans will have to change .
because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming . when the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use .
wow ! i didn't notice the time . it ' s almost noon . i have to get home .
no , no problem . i have my car in the parking ramp around the corner .
sorry i was late for the meeting today . i got stuck in traffic .
did it take you a long time to quit smoking ?
he dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . who would know he is the richest man in town ?
those guys thought they would never lose . but we finally beat them . and look at them crying now .
i feel i work harder when i am under pressure .
there has been talk at school about canceling the concert .
does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ?
i was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me .
it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean .
i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage .
people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do .
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods .
i ’ d love to have my own farm .
i wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy .
that ’ s one reason i ’ d like to try it . i ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office .
my uncle owns a farm and i ’ ve spent some time working with him . i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields .
what ’ s your city like ?
is the traffic bad in the city centre ?
what about restaurants and entertainment ?
is there a lot of nightlife in your city ?
it sounds like a really exciting city to live in .
is your city a historical place ?
how did it grow into such a large place ?
as the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby .
i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ?
do you believe in ufo's ?
i've never thought about it like that before .
do you think that there's life on other planets ?
why is that ?
do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
i suppose you're right .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
i haven't met you at the gym for a long time .
why ? you have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening .
then soho is your ideal work style .
sounds great . are there many business opportunity ?
why ? what was it about ?
a lot of young people have to do that .
lt sounds like the story of my life .
i take sleeping pills sometimes .
it sounds a very depressing film .
somewhere new . it's a great place to pick up chicks .
yeah , i broke up with lisa . she blew a gasket over it . whoa , get a load of that !
never mind the getup . she ' s beautiful !
i'm gonna introduce myself .
oh , oh , that tears it ! i'm getting out of here .
my ex girlfriend's here . if she sees me , my goose is cooked .
what's the problem , nada ? you look down in the dumps .
come on , nothing can be that bad .
ok , i promise . so what's troubling you so much ?
really ? is he married ?
then what's your problem ?
oh , i see . office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
office romance is very tricky .
mike , what are you doing tonight ?
yeah , but it's expensive . nah , i'm going to yy's .
they ' ve just renovated the place . you may be surprised .
quite a difference , huh ?
ah hah . thought you were't drinking .
hi , bob , i am so glad that you came .
yeah . it's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i'm still trying to find my place in this world . it's only recently that i've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn
oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i don't want us to drift apart again .
how's it going ?
to be honest , i'm a bit fed up .
there's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around .
sure , but how ?
easier said than done .
but i always get tongue tied when i see her .
i see . i'll try .
hi , mary . i haven't seen you in ages ! i heard that you and daniel are getting married on august 8th , the opening day of the 2008 olympic games . is it true ?
good for you ! it sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
is everything ready now ?
have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
it's an excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
i guess you're right . i can help you ask other hotels . i am sure there are probably some available .
how are you doing , christopher ?
are you doing anything this weekend ?
are you available on sunday ?
ok , well , my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday . we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . do you want to come with us ?
it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
do you like surfing ?
the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland , so you must have been to disneyland .
well , i've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
some time next year . we haven't set the date yet .
thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ?
for the most part , yes . some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
jack and mary broke up .
mary said jack was cheating on her . jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . one day , mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .
no , he doesn ’ t . anyway , she found out that he had been two timing her for a long time .
how so ?
poor mary ! she really liked him .
do you think they ’ ll get back together ?
i hope she ’ ll recover soon .
i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car .
i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it's just so convenient .
do you have a car ?
maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn't be so tempted to use it .
i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere !
this is tough to say , jordan , but i think we should break up .
yes , i mean it .
no , we are just too different . this isn ’ t working .
i have thought about it for a while . i think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .
i ’ m sorry .
then why didn ’ t you talk to me ?
i think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart .
hello , deva , how are you ?
not bad . have you heard wendy divorced her husband ?
you said it . you know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage .
yeah . we chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners .
we've heard so much about chinese film stars divorcing foreigners .
what are you listening to ? is that beethoven or mozart ?
i think beethoven's music is incredible . i've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . do you believe that ?
what other kind of music do you listen to ?
to be honest , i think classical music is too complicated for me .
i like pop music . do you ?
i've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ?
so , how did you become interested in it ?
do you still play piano ?
do you have any plans for friday night ?
well , my hosue mates and i are having a house warming party . would you like to come ?
i'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school .
don't worry . you won't be sitting there by yourself .
most people are working friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm .
we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great .
hi , come on in . can i take your coat ?
you're the first guest to arrive . i'll just put your coat away and then i'll get you something to drink .
whatever you prefer .
just over three weeks . would you like a drink ?
i've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .
marcia and paul called to cancel at the last moment . paul was running late and marcia wasn't feeling well .
i think there's someone at the door .
hi , chary , are you busy this evening ?
how old is he today ?
well , wish him a happy birthday for me .
i was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
sorry , i've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
how's it going ?
to be honest , i'm a bit fed up .
well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did .
a bit ? i'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! he's such a liar .
in the long run , i think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but i know that i'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first .
what would you do if you were me ?
so . what kind of things do you do in your free time ?
i like to do just about anything outdoors . do you enjoy camping ?
have you ever been camping in the boundary waters ?
it's fantastic . my family and i are very fond of the place .
i have a canon slr .
i'd call it one of my hobbies . do you know much about photography ?
have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ?
how about at 11:00 ?
why are you in such a good mood today ?
i didn't know you were scared of heights ! was it really bad ?
so what did you do about it yesterday ?
you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary !
weren't you scared ?
so have you cured your fear of heights ?
i'm impressed .
well , sometimes i get scared when i'm in my apartment all by myself .
i always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things .
what sort of music do you like ?
so , you're into 80s music then ?
i like alternative music .
to be honest , no . i'm always in search of new music to listen to .
i usually go to see a live band about twice a month . what about you ?
there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . you should come along next week with me .
that's too bad . maybe another time .
there's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight .
are you sure you don't need any help ?
i swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller !
yes . what about you ?
oh , i guess i'll let you through then .
that's alright . i notice you have a few newspapers there . would you mind lending me one ?
i prefer the british paper , but i'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away .
thanks a lot . that's really nice of you . would you like a piece of gum ?
did you enjoy that new movie ?
oh , what happened , carole ?
what ? i met him just before i took off from kitty's , he said he was coming .
looks like it . so how did he handle it to ?
i think that's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me .
doesn't sound promising .
if you want i'll let him know if i run into him .
excuse me ; is this seat taken ?
thank you very much . my name is ashlan . it's nice to meet you .
the weather is so warm for december , don't you think ?
global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere .
no . i'm new here . i just moved here a few months ago .
i'm from china . what about you ?
did you enjoy it ?
it's very different from chinese food , but i am getting used to it .
yes , have you read it ?
well , to be honest , i've only gotten though 10 pages of it . so far , though , it's interesting .
hi , mike , what gives ?
hey , great set of wheels .
who wouldn't ? wow , that's out of this world .
yeah , too cool . how much did they sold you for ?
i can imagine .
i'd love to .
hey , jack , where's your car ?
ok . boy , this looks expensive .
wow , this's sinking a hole .
i believe it . hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .
wow , this car can really burn rubber .
you made a perfect choice , jack .
thanks for inviting me to work out with you , joan .
yeah , this place looks great . wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ?
a little , i wish i could do that .
look at him , he's buff .
how do they all get in such tiptop shape ?
that's it . i decided to turn over a new leaf . i'm going to exercise every single day .
hi paul . how are you , friend .
how so ?
have you talk to him about it ?
ahahah , maybe that will help you lose weight .
sorry paul . i couldn't help it . so why doesn't he give you a hand ?
hi , mikel . what's with you ? you look angry .
just kidding , mikel . why don't you come work out with me ?
it works if you keep at it . come on , let's go !
this feels great . i'm all reed up . i can keep going all night .
exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig .
you look like a basket case .
what's the problem ?
yeah , and ?
why ?
i guess you think twice next time he comes .
so how long has he here for ?
good morning !
i slept like a baby . i fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares !
i feel much better , but i'm still worried about something .
well , i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and i'm going to end up getting stuck in rush hour traffic .
for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because i'm pretty impatient . how can i prevent myself from getting stressed if i get stuck in a traffic jam ?
ok , i'll try that .
just one more thing . a school called me this morning to see if i could teach a few classes this weekend and i don't know what to do .
i'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on monday .
wow ! you're going to tibet ?
that's really cool ! i've always dreamed of going somewhere like tibet , seeing something unique .
nothing particular .
then make sure that you book me a room , too .
and check whether they accept credit cards .
how come you're still up ? shouldn't you be asleep by now ?
as far as i know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . are you stressed at all ?
you're a good student . i'm sure you can do well . what you need to do is to relax .
taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress .
you need to take some breaks throughout the day . studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective .
besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . in fact , i can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! you just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply .
oh , i'm sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
well , my friends and i are planning on going to shangri la on saturday . do you want to come with us ?
not very far from here . we'll fly . it's about one and a half hours .
there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .
yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
hi , darling ! i have a one month vacation saved up . how about a trip to europe ?
oh , but i really need to leave this town for a change . working day after day has worn me out . do you have any other suggestions ?
wonderful ! i think that's a great idea . how soon until we can make this happen ? i can't wait !
perfect . i'll start preparing tomorrow . if we're going to drive , i'll need to fill up the tank .
we can take the train , that will be faster . i'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
no problem . i'm really looking forward to the coming week .
what a nice day !
great , let's go !
exactly . you know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . you remember ? the island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine .
why not go again to celebrate out one year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
ok . i'll make the arrangements . it will be great .
hey , mary , what's up ?
oh , that's exciting . what's this guy like ? is he hot ?
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ?
what about a factory tour ?
yes . i heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . we can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry .
i'm not sure , but as far as i know , most factory tours are free . they are sponsored by the company providing the tour .
i believe most of them think of it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better known .
exactly .
i must have taken a wrong turn .
and then ?
thanks a lot .
by the way , how long does it take ?
i heard the great wall closes early in the afternoon . do you think i can make it before closing ?
great ! thank you !
is she american ?
so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?
sounds like you've got some competition . you made a move already ?
that's nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ?
good luck !
hey , lucas , how was your trip to paris ?
did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ?
what else did you see ?
you must have had a great time .
yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . sometimes new food might disagree with you .
that is great . everyone says french food is wonderful .
jessica is going back to holland next week . i've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but i still have no clue .
yeah , that's her . we had a lot of wonderful times together . she is really a special friend , and i want to get her something meaningful .
i don't think so . that way it would lose all the charm . i want it to be a surprise . i want to show her that i care about her and i hope our friendship will last .
hmm , i think i've got an idea . maybe i can get her an ever green plant to take back home .
i hope so . i'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . i hope it won't cause her trouble at the border .
who are you writing a letter to ?
ok . i guess i could add something . tell them that i send my love .
well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion .
just today . i guess i forgot to mention it .
it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . we might as well just sign off .
i guess you can write that i'm looking forward to seeing them in june .
and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the christmas package they sent us .
what would you do without me ?
have you heard about the new iphone ?
i'd like to . it's a cell phone , camera , pad and mp3 player all in one .
how big is a shuffle ipod ?
how many gigs of music can it hold ?
how much do they cost ?
you're right , that's not bad at all .
do you know what camcorder options are available ?
would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ?
ok . this sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . why don't you see if you like the way it feel ?
it's got an above average battery life . it lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes .
yes , that is an option .
yes . i can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark .
it can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera .
there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one .
what's up ?
what's wrong ?
are you using dial up or broadband ?
in that case , you need to turn on your airport .
oh , no . you can register for free . just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it .
well , you can always block them . when i don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what i do .
it's aubreyinchina@yahoo . com .
you wouldn't believe what i got in the mail today !
it's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai !
no , i thought i'd wait until you got home .
ok . it says , dear jessica . it was so good to receive you letter . i sounds like you and riley are settling into your new home with ease .
just a few weeks ago . sue and i send letters to each other often .
ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah . ray and i look forward to seeing you in june . write soon . with love , sue .
didn't i tell you ? we're going to shanghai to stay with them in june .
is that your phone ?
it's very impressive . can you use the internet on your phone ?
no , but i think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go .
does it have a camera ?
i guess so . would you mind if i checked my email quickly ? i'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client .
have you checked your voicemail recently ?
i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message .
do you want to listen to your messages first ?
i'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone .
it's not that bad . it kind of feels like i'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time !
do you like playing games ?
how about individual games like the rubik's cube or solitaire ?
if i taught you how to do it , i'm sure you could solve it .
hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . if you give me some hints about playing that ps2 game , i ’ ll show you how to solve the rubik's cube .
i don't know . i haven't tried yo yo since that party !
if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it .
if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ?
will you get a pay raise , too ?
that makes sense . who interviewed you ?
what kinds of questions did she ask you ?
the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . what did you tell her ?
those are good answers . how did she react ?
what do you think about her as a boss ?
you're lucky . not everyone has such a great boss !
when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know .
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ?
first of all , i want you to know that i really like working for this company . do you think i'm doing a good job here ?
i try very hard . the problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . now that i have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent .
i could really use a 5 % rise .
listen , if you give me a raise , i'll take on extra responsibilities .
that's fine . do i get over time for any extra hours that i work ?
that sounds good to me . i really appreciate it .
do you mind if i sit here ?
don't i know you ?
you're right ! how are you ? it's been a long time !
that sounds exciting . where did you go ?
i went to a small school in connecticut . it has a very good reputation for its languages department .
yes , i got a grant to study chinese .
it is , but it's very rewarding .
i can , but not as well as i'd like to . i'll be studying chinese until the day i die !
do you have your passport with you ?
fortunately for you , you don't . next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
let me see here . yes , there's one left .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
i have some good news for you . we've decided we'd like to send you to shanghai on a business trip this weekend .
don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ?
i thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . everything will be paid for and i'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . all you have to do it get on the train tonight a
oh , no . we've brought your return ticket for you . i think you'll find it comfortable .
oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . besides , you're in first class , so you'll be fine .
they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . that should give you enough time to have a quick shower .
we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system .
the may holiday is coming up soon . are you planning on going on vacation ?
where are you planning on going ?
i went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there .
personally , i think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital .
it ’ s a beautiful city , but i think it ’ s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ?
maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing .
since the may holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here ’ s the phone number .
hey , frank , there is that janet check .
she sure knows how to strut her stuff .
and look out she's dressed .
i think you've lost it .
i admit that she is much prettier than kate .
welcome back ! how was your vacation ?
where did you end up going ?
i've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ?
sure . what's this one a picture of ?
you don't look very happy in that picture .
so what did you do ?
my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ?
hi , how are you doing ?
same here . have you seen any new films recently ?
oh , really ? i saw it two years ago . it's worth seeing and it's thought provoking .
it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever changing world .
well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too .
oh , that's too short lived .
i can't agree more . the only child generation in china tends to know little about marriage .
in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone .
oh , hi , jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
i'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ?
more and more chinese are marrying foreigners .
oh , why ?
i wouldn't say that's totally true . i've met many happy intercultural couples .
i guess it's because the chinese women are more attractive to western men .
what do you mean ?
a left girl ? what's that ?
you have a point here , but i believe some mixed marriages are based on true love .
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a chinese ?
not yet . but i wonder if i can get my parents ’ consent .
you are right . it is giving me a real headache . i feel like i ’ m between a rock and a hard place .
oh , how did you deal with it ?
oh , it ’ s a pity . what was the matter ?
like what ?
oh , i see . in their culture women should put family first .
so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner .
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ?
but we've done that many times . we want something fresh this time .
sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive .
i don ' t think so . i don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . but we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party byob .
maybe you have a point . how about having a party on a friday afternoon ? we'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . there'll be music but no band . having the party in the office will make
pretty good . my colleagues seem alright . so far everything is great .
indeed . team work is highly valued in this new company . i like our boss too . he is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . he's highly respected by all his employees .
true , take my former supervisor as an example . he was extremely controlling and overbearing . he always had to micromanage everything .
hi , natasha , how's life ?
oh , you must be very happy . how many people are there in your family ?
yes , it did . but my parents are ethnic minority people . it's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children .
the child must feel very longly . my younger brother is 10 years younger than me . before he was born , i used to be the only child and always dreamed that i would have a younger sister or brother one da
yes , we are very close . he is 12 years old and very smart . he always makes us laugh a lot .
this party rocks !
i'm with you on that . check out that one over there . i think i'm in love !
oh , that's janice . she's just new in town . you have a thing for blonds , eh ?
i bet . why not go over and talk to her ? she's really nice .
come on ! man up ! you'll never know until you try .
all right . but i think you ought to move soon .
i can see five other guys eying her up .
do you have internet in your room ?
really ? what do you usually do online ?
i never chatted online before . what's it like .
really ? who do you chat with ?
that's amazing . i will install an online messenger program when i get home .
org ! it must be so late where you are . what time is it ?
what's wrong ? can't sleep ?
really ? what is it ?
i can't believe it ! is it real ? you're moving here ?
just give me the dates and i'll make sure i'm free . you know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . i look forward to seeing you soon !
thanks . this is so exciting . sleep tight and sweet dreams !
hi , mary ! what do you like to do in your spare time ?
what a confidence ! i always watch a lot of movies , too .
really impressive . these two genres are totally different .
how often do you go to the cinema ?
movie salon ? where is that ?
is it good ?
really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership .
hello , jason , there is going to be a screening of final destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . i plan to go to see it .
yeah , i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ?
that's funny , i didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside .
alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ?
that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies .
not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy .
really ? i haven't heard of it .
you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china .
you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you
then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you .
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i don't know , but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
no , it's not going to be george . i don't think it's andy either . he is involved with the boss's sister in law . and you know how whipped our boss is .
lisa ? no way . i've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
the band is pretty good . how do you like the music ?
don't worry . i'm not much of a dancer myself .
how about tango ?
tango is my favorite . anything but hip hop or the foxtrot .
my pleasure . let's go and have a drink .
i really admire you , diana .
you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school .
isn't there anything else ?
you must have a high iq score .
go ahead .
well , perhaps you're right . sometimes eq matters more than iq .
hi , i'm lucas , i just moved in next door .
thanks . some tea would be nice . chinese tea is great . i really like your tea set . where did you get it ?
oh yeah , i saw the tea house the other day . i think i might go and have a look sometime . it's a nice neighborhood here .
what's your opinion about childless couples ? will you choose to have no kids ?
why ? do you have to make a choice now ?
what's the puzzle ?
oh , i see . i think the older generation tend to think in a different way .
oh , really ? maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren .
definitely .
don't worry . i think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .
have you ever thought about your ideal home ?
how many rooms would it have ?
how many bedrooms would your dream home have ?
how would you decorate your house ?
how many tvs would your dream home have ?
what a nice garden ! look at these tulips !
all right . would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? good . smile . say cheese . ok , got you . that's terrific .
no problem .
do you know how to set the timer ?
ok , let's have a try .
did it come out ?
never mind . let's go to the falls and try again .
finally we're on board !
are they window seats or aisle seats ?
ok . but can i trade my seat with you ? i prefer the one near the window . i'm a terrible flyer . i always get airsick and can never relax until after i've landed .
thanks . where shall we put our luggage ?
good idea .
ok . hope it's a pleasant trip .
and no hijackers .
is this seat taken ?
thanks .
yes , on a business trip . how about you ?
yes , i went there once last summer .
i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i didn't enjoy was the subway .
yes . there were always so many people . after taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans .
that's a good idea . wish you a great vacation !
hello , ms . barkley . how are you ?
good to see you again , too . how ’ s you family ?
hi , jim . how are you ? i haven ’ t seen you for a while .
where were you ?
matthew ? hi !
it's got to be almost a year now .
not yet . i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck .
mrs . thou ?
great . it's a lovely neighborhood . and it would be nice to be neighbors again . it would be just like the old days !
what's your apartment like ?
what is it like living in on campus housing ?
did you have to pay a deposit ?
do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ?
how long is your contract for ?
have you started looking again yet ?
you haven't spent much time with sophia lately . are you speaking to each other at the moment ?
but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other's company .
can't you hang out with them , too ?
maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you .
it can't be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you .
she's probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend .
i still think you two should try to patch things up .
what was your wedding ceremony like , abigail ?
three parties ? that's quite a lot . that must have been expensive !
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
mary , how was your date with john ?
oh , really . that is great news . what does he look like ?
sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ?
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
come on , mary , you're a total catch . i bet he will call you . don't worry .
you are dressed to kill . you look gorgeous , alexander .
how did you meet each other ?
is this your first date ?
sure it will . oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . i'm going to be late for my date .
absolutely not ! he's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i'm over with him . he's history !
a guy i met on the internet three month ago .
please don't be so fussy ! i didn't just meet him yesterday .
i wonder what he looks like . oh , i can't wait to see him ! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is .
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
how dare you !
why did you lie to me in the email ?
i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me .
hey , lily , what are you doing ?
you mean the boy you met on msn ?
you must be joking . you can't fall in love with someone you've never met !
i think it's just a crush . you can't be serious .
did you tell him ?
you shouldn't take it too seriously . it might be a lie .
but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ?
so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ?
how about drinking soda ?
that's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ?
how do you know so much about food and dieting ?
i feel absolutely horrible . my temperature is 41 degrees celsius , and i've got a headache and a runny nose .
i've also got a terrible stomach ache . is my face still swollen ?
yes , for the most part . it doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway .
no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . i think it's already healed .
i scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago .
i took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch .
just some water , please . do you have any ointment for my nose ? it feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much .
you don't look too well . maybe you should take the day off from work .
do you feel ok ?
why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
you're really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down .
zach , what's that on your arm ?
it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ?
i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . let's go .
we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
i'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions .
i'm not really in the mood for italian , actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
i really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . but , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .
that's right . it'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .
are you sure ? we could go dutch .
hey ayden , i was wondering if you could do me a favor .
it's kind of a big favor . i'm absolutely flat broke , and i owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until friday to give it to her , but i don't get paid until next monday . do you think you could loans
if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . i'll pay you back on monday . i promise .
thanks a lot ayden . every little bit will help . tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place .
how about at 6 pm ?
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?
yes , i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .
that's what i thought you would do . listen , i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it's just down the street from all the bars . you probably don't want to be walking around after dark .
i wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here .
do me a favor , and take a taxi . it'd make me feel a lot better .
when i first moved in , i walked everywhere . but within a week , i had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! now , i always take public transportation .
nothing else has happened to me , but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close .
does your family have a record of your ancestors ?
do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? i ’ d love to see it .
that ’ s amazing . do you have a large extended family ?
are you very close to your first cousins ?
i see . who ’ s the head of your household ?
that ’ s interesting . what does your grandfather think of your step mother ?
hey , teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ?
ok , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ?
i'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ?
and he looks like a typical jog .
ah ha , i thought so .
what did you mean ?
that's right .
have you ever seen bill gate's home on the internet ?
it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . the house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through
i think his house is fantastic , but i wouldn't want to live there . you would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro
old homes are great because they've got character . i think that's important .
no , that's just because i don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !
hey , vernassa . why be angry look ?
i've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ?
are you sure she was trying to put you down ?
you shall go easy on her . she is new here .
you shall just take it in surprise .
try to pull it together , vernassa . i am sure things will turn note , ok ?
well . if you think i can help , let me know .
how many people are there in your family ?
wow . that is a very big family . do you all live together ?
but you don't live at home anymore .
my goodness ! your family must live in a huge house .
wow ! you grew up in a school ! no wonder your english is excellent !
you are so lucky !
that's what i did in america . i was reading all the time . i was never a big tv watcher . tv wastes time .
800 books ? i'm impressed !
hey , the new soho . how's everything going ?
your office ? aren't you a freelancer ?
a virtual office ?
sounds fun . what else ?
oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image .
how could you handle living in such a big family ? does everyone get along ?
in such a big family , there must be a head . who's the head of your family ?
is a family like yours common in south korea ?
my family setup is a bit different . in new york city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . during this summertime , i fly out to california and live with my dad . dad's getting
to be blunt , maybe i won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids .
but four boys !
you are right , i guess . the world keeps changing , and so do families . but i like a small sized or medium sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . that's what i want .
that's a great idea !
can you play baseball with me today ?
where's the new house ? is it far from here ?
can i help you pack ?
i haven't danced for a long time .
we must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance .
i've been studying hard for my examinations . and you ?
well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances .
did you watch television last night , charles ?
what a pity . it was quite exciting . both teams played very well .
it finished in a draw . what was the film like ?
i wish i could . but i'm afraid i can't . i've got some serious studying to do . i have to go .
see you on moday . have a great weekend .
good morning , sue .
i'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ?
i am heading for the library . i've got a research project to do . how about you ?
see you later , alligator .
hi , john ! i haven ’ t seen you for ages .
i ’ m glad to see you , too . how ’ ve you been ?
not bad . i finally bought a house . it ’ s an old one , but built really solid . it is close to here . do you want to come over for lunch ?
ok , next time you ’ re here .
tell me more .
sounds great !
i want to see disney world , sea world , universal studios , and weeki watchee springs .
i ’ m jealous . i ’ ve never been to florida .
that sounds great ! i ’ ll take you up on that invitation .
i sure will .
count on it . and here ’ s my card . don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime .
well , i ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . have a good trip .
i will . good bye .
can i use your laptop for a while ?
oh my , no internet access is killing me .
no , i'm not feeling myself . i just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends .
what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me .
that's alright . i just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . it almost drives me crazy .
are you a blogger ?
oh , it seems that i'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ?
what do you usually write about ?
that's interesting . how often do you write a blog ?
got it . are you still updating your blog ?
not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . i can't believe it !
addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way !
absolutely .
yeah , it's a must . otherwise , i may miss important phone calls and text messages .
yes . msn , qq , skype , google talk , ali wangwang , everything , so that i'll be in touch with all friends and relatives .
do mona and jim need a new house ?
does jim make a lot of money ?
does jim need to make more money ?
what do they need all that money for ?
what does jim like to do ?
wow . she sounds like a high maintenance wife .
politics can be an expensive hobby .
politics is a hard game to play .
what date is it today ?
look at the girls in the street . they all have bunch of flowers . is it valentine's day ?
did you have a fight with jack ?
come on , dear ! you forgot it , too .
is that your phone ?
wow ! good timing .
what did you think of the movie ?
oh , i see .
thanks for the sweet words .
mary , please go to the door . i hear the bell .
give it to me . how wonderful ! he's coming to visit us .
he's coming by car on the twenty fourth . he's staying from thetwenty fourth to the twenty sixth .
no , he's coming with aunt cynthia and the girls .
your cousin fay is fifteen . rosemary is older than fay . she's seventeen .
of course . the girls can stay in your room with you .
if you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things .
i'm glad we live in a small town .
because the houses look so nice at christmas time .
did you play football yesterday ?
what did you do after you'd played football ?
are you helping him all afternoon ?
you're , going to be very busy .
if i won the pools , i'd go round the world .
what would you do ?
as i said , i'd go round the world .
oh , i don't know . it'd take me a long time to go round the world .
anyway , we haven't won the pools , and we're not likely to win them . so there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ?
what'll you have ?
i'd have a scotch if i were you . we deserve it .
what will you do all day ?
have you ever worked ?
i'm going to camp . i've gone to camp for four summers .
we do many things . in the morning , we go swimming and boating . in the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . we sit around a camp fire at night . we sing or tell stories .
it is wonderful . what's john going to do this summer ?
well , so long , mary . have fun .
are you going to leave school at the end of the term ?
what does a clerk do ?
i want to be a vet .
a vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . he's an animal doctor .
who is your favorite nba star ?
kobe ? i know him , the key guy of the lakers , a heck of a nba player . he is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense .
maybe he is not good ay rebounding ?
kobe came to beijing during this summer's olympics . did you go to the match between china and usa ?
well then , what are your spoils ?
which of the two do you think is better ? i mean , what's the difference between them ?
i only want it for the kitchen . i like to listen to the news at breakfast time .
hmm . i'd like the cheaper one , please . can i pay hy cheque ?
hello , mrs turnbull . how are you ?
school , you mean ? yes , he does . he likes his teachers , and that always makes difference .
no , he walks . he likes walking . he meets some of his friends at the corner another go together .
hi , fanny .
are you feeling ok ? you sound a little tired this morning .
what happened ?
oh , what a nightmare ! then what happened ?
you have got a great mother .
that sounds good !
in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls .
guess who i saw yesterday ?
avril lavigen !
yeah , i worked as temporary staff in her concert . look , her poster , a cd .
not really . but i like some of her songs . she's actually very talented . she's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too .
yes , though i don't think her acting skills are that great .
she looked sweeter than her pictures .
good evening , john .
how are you doing ?
nothing special .
sounds good . sorry , here comes my bus . you call me , or i'll call you to make a date .
all right . gotta go , bye , keep in touch .
julie , what's on the tube ?
yeah . maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? let's see if there's a game on .
it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . keep surfing .
oh , i know this kind of shows . sometimes they really piss me off . if i wanted reality , i'd go outside .
i don't get it . we have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! maybe we should just turn off the tv , get outside , and do something real .
have you adapted to the lifestyle in china ?
what ?
what is it ?
that makes you feel uncomfortable ?
perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
well , that's not rare . i've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
yeah .
hey , jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the tv all day . anything interesting on tv ?
why don't you turn off the tv and get outside ? you need to get some fresh air .
really ? what's the series about ?
it sounds interesting , but i am not a big fan of tv shows . they're time consuming and don't have much depth .
really ? that's interesting !
have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ?
as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm i
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
i heard that ben is forming his own band .
can you play a musical instrument ? if you can , he might ask you to join the band .
i wish i could play a musical instrument . i love music .
i'd love to try it . but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice .
i heard you received a prize for you book .
congratulations ! you must be very proud of your achievement .
what was the prize ?
that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! have you ever won a prize before ?
what kind of music do you like listening to ?
yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work .
classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .
yes . that ’ s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i ’ m cooking or doing other housework .
you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . you can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .
do you like animals ? i really like dogs .
i like wild animals . i don ’ t like spiders and snakes . i think spiders and snakes are disgusting .
i think bears are wonderful . pandas are fantastic . i low the people who kill them for their fur .
what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ?
your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? start with some basic ones . when your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak
i can ’ t make a decision . you ’ ll have to put forward an idea .
i often do , but i ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
i ’ m worried that what i say will not make sense .
that ’ s a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ?
i didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
i ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend .
how might you spend the weekend .
i might do that too . i hope the weather is nice . i could go and play some golf .
hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends .
i heard that janet has got a new job . she ’ s working for the united investment group . i hear that they pay very well .
now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states .
they did . he inherited the money form an uncle . i hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government .
he said that he would probably invest most of it . he ’ s got a well paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day to day expenses . he just wants some extra money available for when he retires .
really ? have you won a fortune in the lottery ?
how are the children doing at sport ?
he ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long distance running ?
how are they at swimming ?
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ ve retired ?
what do you have for breakfast ?
that sounds nice . how do you spend your mornings ?
i watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . it was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features .
well . there was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them .
no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because i ’ d like to see it in action .
they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect molle
that ’ s right . that ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .
according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation .
which sports are popular in your country ?
in my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . a few people like extreme sports , but i think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them .
i know loads of people who play it regularly . there are plenty of golf courses around the country . in the past , only a tiny number of people played .
do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ?
it seems that the climate in this country is changing .
i think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment .
are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa .
what is the international community doing to help ?
how many countries have been affected ?
i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
i went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning .
so did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon . it was raining cats and dogs .
we really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round .
i guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable .
what methods do you use to conserve water ?
i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced .
perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops .
we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible .
i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways .
that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well .
have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals .
what are the seasons like in your city ?
does it ever rain in summer ?
what are spring and autumn like ?
well , i live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . we get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . in winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine
no , i don ’ t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?
we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries
in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e
have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? you could get involved with projects to improve the environment .
what do you do in summer ?
i don ’ t often go for walks , but i either play sports outside you know , tennis or badminton or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book .
well , i play sports indoors quite often . if i ’ m feeling lazy , i just watch a film at home . i prefer summer to winter .
yes . i like wearing shorts in summer . my legs would freeze !
i was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . it was very interesting .
the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
yes , i can . i don ’ t ride regularly though . how about you ?
the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow .
in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms .
we do have a few foggy days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ?
have you ever had snow in your city ?
the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go ice skating on it . on summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean .
both our countries are quite small . how would you describe the landscape in your country ?
is it really completely flat ?
that doesn ’ t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs , then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs .
is there a lot of crime in your city ?
it ’ s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs .
some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach .
which countries have you been to ?
i thought you had been to australia too .
i think i ‘ d say norway . it has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains .
well , the north of norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter .
when in rome , do as the romans do , they say .
they live in rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . but sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk .
yes , but they do it differently . everything is different .
well , the climate's different for a start . it doesn't rain so much as it does in england . the sun shines more often .
i know . you hate the rain , don't you ?
and a roman really ioves life . eye knows how to enjoy himself .
not always . but they like a good meal . lots of tourists go to rome just for the food , you know .
hello , jim . where are you going ?
do you go to the cinema a lot ?
do you know what's on tonight by any chance ?
oh , i see . by the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ?
oh , does she ? that's convenient .

let's play chess .
that's all right , i'm a beginner . i've just learnt how to play .
you're a very good player
so did i . i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
what was the party like last night , jean ?
i don't like them . i used to take them when i had to work overtime , you know .
three every night .
because i was under a terrible strain . the doctor saidthey weren't very strong . anyway , i used to feel awful the next morning .
the doctor said i had to be careful .
wake up sleepyhead . the sun is beginning to shine . what a lovely summer day !
it's not that hot . it's cooler than yesterday . let's go swimming !
yeah , sounds like fun . i can wear my new pink bikini .
who cares ! well , the smart guys get there early . that's the kind of guy i want to meet . let's go !
when was america discovered , tony ?
america was discovered by christopher columbus in 1492 .
all right . ask me a question now .
that's easy . it was invented by edison .
i can't answer that . but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
all right . what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
it's a beautiful day , isn't it ?
do you now the temperature today ?
how nice . i hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . i'm going on the canoe trip this weekend .
what a nuisance ! every time i plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . the sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops . well , i'd better stay home .
where are you going for your holidays , charles ?
good gracious ! you certainly are lucky . how are you going there ?
i once went to singapore by air . it was very exciting but never again .
for a short time . one of the engines caught fire .
he put it out and flew back to the airport . then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was .
we've got a new manager in our department .
yes , i did .
someone called drexler . carl drexler . he's been with the company onlytwo years . i've been here longer . and i know more about the job , too
because i'm the wrong sex , of course !
yes , that was probably it ! it isn't fair .
a dark suit . white shirt . a tie . why ?
you mean you think i didn't get the job because i come to work in jeansand a sweater ?
do you really think i should wear different clothes ?
why should i wear a skirt ? or a dress ?
why should i do that ? i'm good at my job ! that's the only important thing !
i had broken up with him , how painful i feel . i ’ m going to drown my sorrows .
i've never thought about it like that before .
do you think that there's life on other planets ?
why is that ?
do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?
i suppose you're right .
do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ?
you have drank dozens of cups . you are bound to get a bay window .
i ’ m betting the new york yankees win . how about you ?
sorry , guys . could i just interrupt for a moment ? my money is on the yankees !
hey , ken . good luck if you already put your money on the red sox .
what did you do over the weekend ?
do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?
like what ?
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
how about recycling ? does that actually help ?
what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?
i had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !
would you take $ 12 ?
13 . 50 ?
i have never experienced a roller coaster . i want you to sit beside me .
we have waited for a long time . when will we start ?
nice dress . how do i look ? be honest .
well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . and i don ’ t feel comfortable with that . what do you think , vicky ? you ’ ve been very quiet up to now .
i have failed in my final examination . what can i do now ?
where is my contract ?
you know them ?

they ’ re people i met during the trip . that ’ s the ship we traveled on .
that ’ s the man i told you about . remember ?
that ’ s right .

that ’ s right . i grew a beard during the trip , but i shaved it off when i came home .
hello , ken .
have you just been to the cinema ?
what ’ s on ?
yes , i have . i was there in april .
it was spring , but the weather was awful . it rained all the time .
can you recognize that woman , millie ?
i thought so . who ’ s that beside her ?
conrad reeves , the actor ? it can ’ t be . let me have another look . i think you ’ re right ! isn ’ t he her third husband ?
doesn ’ t karen marsh look old !
i ’ m sure she is .
that was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ?
what about this one ? it's a lovely dress . it's very smart . short skirts are in fashion now . would you like to try it ?
where do you come from ?
what's the climate like in your country ?
which seasons do you like best ?
what seems to be the problem ?
of course i did . as recognition for a job well done . once a month i invite the most productive employee to dinner .
i think she's misinterpreted my intentions . what happens now ?
i understand that . but i hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show miss brown that she misunderstood my reaction .
i can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! are you trying to lose your job ?
wow ! nobody told me about that . won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
i guess it lets people express their individual tastes . but won't some people abuse it ?
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
where do you come from ?
what's the climate like in your country ?
what's the weather like in spring ?
what's it like in summer ?

i have lots of work to do . what ’ s more , my grandma is ill .
i miss grandma . i dreamed about her yesterday .
i am so worried about this english contest . i have butterflies in my stomach now !

how many people are there in your family ?
i have a large family . i have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents .
we're identical . i mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else !
we used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn't mention to your biological father .
what about your step brother's mother ? does he keep in touch with her ?
did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ?
they think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
it looks pretty frightening . he doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . most of his nose and chin are missing too .
he was actually quite handsome . what a shame .

have you ever thought about having children , kaitlyn ?
well , i've always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother , i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ?
do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
i don't know about you , but i'm famished . are you interested in getting a bite to eat ?
i'd love something spicy . maybe we could get some sichuan hotpot .

well . ? have you thought of it yet ?
jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ?

she's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me .
not at all . she's actually very athletic .
no , but she does wear contact lenses .
she's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
i think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos
it's a butterfly everyone in her family has one .
yes , even her mom .
she's a lot like me .
come on . don ’ t cheat on me . it ’ s a long shot .
how about going to the cinema tonight ?
i am not sure about the name of the film , but i know it's a romantic one .
don't you think it's too bloody ?
what's your favorite magazine ?

hey , mark , long time no see .
great . i just got back from a week's vacation in thailand .

what are you and corey doing for valentine ’ s day this friday ?
well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time !
what are you doing ?
you really like brains that make you think , don't you ?
i guess the games i like the most are the ones that i'm good at !
well , i like to play darts . whenever i go to a bar , i usually play for a few hours .
my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . we used to have family tournaments every weekend .
not at all . i never really did , to be honest . what about you ? did your family used to play games together ?
some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried that ?
how about mah jong ?
i thought everyone in your country were experts at mah jong !
so , which sport do you prefer basketball or baseball ?
i thought everyone liked basketball . why don't you like it ?
that makes sense .
sure , many times . it's an exciting game for spectators to watch .
not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so i can explain the game to you .
what did you do last night ?
did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game ?
what were the results of the game ?
what was the actual score ?
really ? i thought barcelona was going to win . they are a much better team than madrid .
what happened ?
that explains it .
in a few weeks . are you planning on watching them ?
me , too ! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? i'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9 11 ?
i was at home with my parents in new york city .
i didn't see the crash itself , but i did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building .
no , we decided to stay in our apartment . with all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . it was utter chaos .
yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers .
unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . he ended up dying in the tower .
it was . the hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own .
have you read the feature article about oprah winfrey in this magazine ?
apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity .
i heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world .
you know ; i heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in africa .
yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary .
i agree . so many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels .
did you watch the oscars on sunday night ?
did either one of them win an oscar this year ?
tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! the pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
they're related to one another , yes .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . they've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ?
homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . do you do anything to help them ?
that's a good idea . do they usually accept the food ?
it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in london now .
it's true . the economy is in a bit of mess at the moment .
there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . if only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble .
something's got to change and it's got to happen soon .
what happened ? why didn't he win ?
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
what are you watching on the telly ?
which one is that ?
i've seen the british version and loved it , but have never seen the american version .
have you got satellite , cable , or digital tv ?
do you watch a lot of tv then ?
i don't have a tv at home , so i rarely watch anything . is there anything worth watching after the office ?
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ?
i think you're being a little critical . the actor in the lead role is fantastic . i suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though .
actually , the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine .
that's only part of it . i absolutely adore this director . every play he works on turns out great .
quite a few actually . by the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . my friend has invited us . do you want to go ?
i've never had a part in a play before , but i used to be a part of the stage crew in high school .
i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ?
why not ?
have you ever been in an earthquake ?
do you know where it measured on the richter scale ?
i'm from the plains of the midwest . it's a prime location for tornadoes .
most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room .
actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass .
no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car !
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the usa ?
well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
no , i think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
religious people blame it on pre marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
guess what ! i know something you don't know !
how many planets are there in the solar system ?
not anymore ! can you believe it ? they've decided that pluto is not a planet anymore !
i'm dead serious . they've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore .
yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat .
we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos .
i suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way .
i hope not . i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on earth .
why not ?
it's a pun . they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
perhaps you're right , , though . maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
that's a good point . i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
have you seen the new cosmo magazine that i was reading this morning ?
you're right , thanks . there's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish .
it's martin scorsese . you liked his film , the departed , didn't you ?
sure . you know it has an online edition , too . you should go online to read if you want to read it now .
no . i don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
it's almost three pounds now , and i think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
cosmo mainly has a middle class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
guess what ? i've got great news !
well , you know how i've been working at the economist as a proof reader , right ?
well , the editor in chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back .
it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
yes , but i'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
i don't have any with me , but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
me , too . do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ?
do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ?
what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
well , i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
i suppose i should . i don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
that sounds like fun .
do you have any plans for tomorrow night ?
sure . what movies were you thinking about going to ?
yes . isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed shaun of the dead ?
to be honest , i didn't really like shaun of the dead . besides , i like movies with a happy ending best .
i was thinking of seeing you , me and dupree . it's a typical hollywood blockbuster .
yeah , i suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ?
it depends on who the film is about . which movie did you have in mind ?
that sounds fantastic ! what time is it playing ?
great . shall i meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ?
so , have you seen all three the lord of the rings movies ?
that's the return of the king , right ?
i thought the special effects were amazing , but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me .
no . did you ?
yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me .
most movies are . another problem for me was the film was dubbed in german with english subtitles .
i've got my money and my keys , so i'm ready .
it wasn't cold out this morning .
well , i guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well .
it does , actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping .
ok . i'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it's a bit chilly in here .
i don't know . the weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night .
i don't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ?
if i'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me .
do you have any more questions ?
let's call it a day then . good bye , everyone .
hi , jack ! how are you doing ?
same old thing . what about a drink ?
hello , george ! haven't seen you for some time . where have you been ?
it was good to see you here , john .
who's calling , please ?
what is it , john ?
may i know who's calling ?
aren't you jim green ?
i believe we met at a concert last year . i'm taylor .
we are through .
why ? isn't it obvious ? first you impose way too much on me , and i'm tired away . second , you stood me up on the valentine's day .
but i ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home .
you've got so many cousins . i called you later that night . but you didn't have the guts to answer the phone .
oh , that's right . well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .
why is that ?
i need to go to the bank .
closed ? are you kidding ? what is it , some kind of holiday today ?
oh , it's the first of april , april fool's day
tomorrow is my wife's birthday .
what time is it ?
what ? why ? what's wrong with you ?
you will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . i've got to woke now , i'll be late .
sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all i do just for our family .
i'll spent more time with you in the future , dina .
jim . i heard you got a promotion !
congratulations , guy .
that's a good idea . which one do you recommend ? the pairszone ?
we'll go to the place . could you book a table for 4 at 7 pm ?
good afternoon , peace restaurant , may i help you ?
yes , sir . what time would you like , sir ?
fine , a reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir , may i have your name , please ?
thank you , mr . berman . and you prefer smoking or non smoking ?
i'll try my best . with a toward to having with this tonight , mr . berman .
how are you , kim ? i haven ’ t seen you around for a few days .
i ’ m sorry to hear about that . why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? it ’ ll be good for you !
what ? what ’ s up ?
my son , harvey just got into harvard ! he starts next september .
hello , cindy . congratulations ! i hear you ’ re getting married .
when ’ s the big day ?
hi there , philip . how ’ s everything going ?
i don ’ t blame you . you ’ ve had a busy first week . take a rest !
personnel . may i help you ?
this is she . paul ?
you are going to be really jealous when you find out where i ’ m headed for the holidays !
jack ! do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?
well , this is my new baby . he ’ s just as much trouble . that ’ s for sure ! but , he ’ s a lot of fun !
hi , ellen . that outfit looks terrific !
no , we just don ’ t usually admit it !
i was really glad to hear about your award . congratulations !
sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
you look really wiped out .
not a good day , i hate to tell you that mr . emory wants to see the designs for the polish paste ad tomorrow morning .
thank god ! i am finished writing that service guide ! it took me forever !
this morning ! no more overtime , and no more headaches !
hello mary . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . are you still seeing paul ?
did you break up amicably ? sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up .
yes , i am . we ’ re thinking about getting engaged . we ’ ve been dating for over a year now .
i havn't seen her for a while . she stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her . he was seeing a girl form his office . one day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately .
really ? they ’ ve been together for a long time . when are they getting married ?
thanks . hey , look at that guy over there . i think he fancies you .
her birthday is on the 9th . we ’ re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing .
when will that be ready ?
you ’ re getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you ’ ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel everything .
which hotel will the reception be held at ?
oh , yes . it ’ s and excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
how many people are in your family ?
i have one daughter and one son . then there ’ s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ?
my parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ?
i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters .
about seven years now . and you ?
it ’ s becoming more and more common . however , i don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ?
that girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ?
i ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . he ’ s very broad shouldered .
do you prefer tall girls or short ones ?
we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls probably because i ’ m so tall myself .
no , never . i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ?
how many children do cindy and ron have ?
does their daughter get along well with her in laws ?
do they have a large family ?
how old is keith ?
he's a year older than keith , but he looks younger .
oh , i don't think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
how do you want to spend your old age ?
what's the life expectancy in your country ?
about 70 , i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it's a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
how's your son these days ?
he'll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ?
yes , i think you're right . i'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet .
yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discour
i had a big argument with david yesterday . i hope he ’ s not still mad at me .
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn ’ t have the money yet .
yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn ’ t have got angry .
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill , so i needed the money back .
no , we didn ’ t . i guess you ’ re right . we should patch things up .
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ?
i don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . honesty is very important to me .
you can find out from their friends .
oh , i don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . you never know when they are joking and when they are being serious .
it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . how is it that we are such good friends ?
when you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ?
i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill .
that ’ s what i thought . i just thought i ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ?
did you ? how is he these days ?
i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ?
do you like barry ?
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
you're right . i love going out and making new friends .
are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on friday evening ?
if everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . so i think it should be ok ?
i ’ ve got her a birthday present and i ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too .
helen gets on very well with her neighbors . i wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too .
that was a great party . thanks for saying behind to help me clear up .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn ’ t bother me . that spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?
i ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag .
yes , he ’ s very good isn ’ t he ? he told some funny stories too .
i think that she had a litter too much of the punch .
that ’ s my little secret . did you like the snacks and i prepared ?
so , tell me about your new house . how is it different to your old one ?
so , it ’ s a three bedrooms detached house ?
what ’ s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook .
do you have a balcony ?
you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? there can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ?
so , your friend ’ s getting married on saturday . what have you bought her as a wedding gift . i find is so hard to choose the right gift .
that ’ s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ?
what ’ s wrong with is ?
household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays .
no . i ’ m a little worried about security . you never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . aren ’ t you worry about that ?
i ’ m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
so , how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . while you ’ re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting .
good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . may i help you ?

yes . that ’ s fine . we can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . could you give me your name please ?
yes . do you intend to order a la carte or will you be having our seafood buffet ?
hi , my name is sovia . what ’ s your name ?
what do you do ?
i like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
sure , that ’ d be great . where would you like to go ?
do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
we could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
that's true . but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus .
so which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
hi , mark ! long time no see !
where have you been ?
how was your flight ?
that ’ s too bad . how long was the flight ?
did you have a layover ?

when do you think you will do that ?
susan , good evening . why are you so dressed up ?
you look great . your make up is perfect .
no , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that .
with that dress i'd like to say your white diamond necklace would look perfect .
not much , just a house party with some friends .
yeah , most of the people are from my office .
to be honest , i don't really like doing either one , i can't cook and i hate cleaning .
i would rather do the dishes than cook .
let's make a deal .
i'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook .
how ’ d it go ? did we win ?
sue ? do you want to join the softball team ? we need another player .

you won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the baker account ! me ! i ’ ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime !
they were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and i ’ m left on my own to do the work . this is the first break i ’ ve had all day .

i can't stand being with you any more . i'm sick of your drinking .
how many chances have i given you , i've given up on you .
it's not just for your drinking . but you are lacking sense of responsibility .
even if i was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment .
i had a great time on the last date .

tomorrow is halloween , i know i'm ready . i bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . do you want to help me a jack o lantern ?
they are supposed to say trick or treat ? then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy .

john , i was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year .
what are you talking about ?
you and i have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us !
with that attitude , i don't really think we have much more to discuss here .
joe , how are you doing ?
i am doing great ! thank you for asking , joe .
i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
what were you planning on seeing ?
how about “ the secret life of bees ” ?
brian and christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , john .
are you kidding me ?
we have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together .
go on your vacation with mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well !
do you enjoy going on dates ?
what's so fun about them ?
so you always have fun on dates ?
why not ?
so then why would you ask them out in the first place ?
john , i was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .
you can't be serious !
after a year together , i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
you know , now that i think about it , i really don't have much more to say to you at all !
things are going well for me , joe .
my parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
what movie did you want to see ?
i was thinking that i would like to see “ the secret life of bees . ”

yes , it would be .
me too . i can't wait until winter .
hello , may i speak to alice please ?

until then .
is alice available ?
i've called you a hundred times today .
no problem .
how about a movie ?
call me tomorrow then .
it doesn't look very nice outside today .
in the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining .
considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird .
i know , you're absolutely right .
that's how i feel , i want winter to come soon .
i know what you mean , but i'd rather be cold than hot .
have you attended school today ?
i wasn't able to attend school because i was feeling ill .
i would really appreciate that , thanks .
if you get sick , i'll return the favor .
i wish it was a nicer day today .
it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .
it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather .
that's right , it really would be .
i know what you mean , i can't wait until it's winter .
i would rather deal with the winter than the summer .
i wish it was a nicer day today .
it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer .
it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather .
i would rather deal with the winter than the summer .
did you hear the good news ?
i got a promotion at my job .
seriously , i am so excited .
thank you .
really ?
you think so ?
i haven't told you what happened yet , have i ?
my boss offered me a promotion , and i took it .
yes , i am really excited .
i appreciate that .
for real ?
have you gone to school today ?
i couldn't go to school today , i was sick .
thank you very much , that's kind of you .
when you miss a day of school , i'll be happy to give you the english assignments .
have you heard my good news ?
i got a promotion at work earlier this week .
it's the truth . i am really happy .
thank you very much .
are you really ?
is that what you really think ?
did you hear the news ?
our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week .
i would've thought that somebody would have told you .
are you going to go and visit her and the baby ?
good ! i just thought i'd let you know .
have you heard the news ?
deborah had her baby last week .
i thought you heard .
she was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces .
i know , you should really go and see her and the baby .
i just wanted to let you know what happened .
have you heard what happened ?
deborah already had her baby .
i thought you knew .
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
will you go and visit them ?
what a wonderful dinner !
where did you get your fantastic recipes ?
i especially like the wonderful chicken dish .
is that shrimp in the soup ?
i am happy that the wine i brought for you works well with this meal .
my fish is pretty dry too .
yes , it seems that way to me also .
my vegetables are very soggy .
i don't usually complain , but i think that we should mention this to the waiter .
george , is your chicken ok ?
my fish is very dry .
that's exactly what i was thinking had happened .
the vegetables are kind of mushy .
the food here is usually good , so i think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem .
this is a great meal !
who taught you how to cook this well ?
is the soup a shrimp soup ?
i think i got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal .
i really love this meal .
i was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup .
it worked out well that the wine that i brought to share seems to blend well with this meal .
would you like some more coffee ?
good luck finding the waitress !
i'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
so the total is $ 36 . 00 for our dinner .
i think that we should leave 10 % .
do you want some dessert ?
i'll walk over and get the bill , since i don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon .
so the bill is $ 36 . 00 .
my first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip .
let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service .
does your chicken taste all right ?
yes , maybe they are short handed in the kitchen tonight .
the vegetables seem to not be very fresh .
i usually enjoy the meals here , so i think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal .
you look really nice today .
really , where did you get it ?
it's really nice .
thank you . i just got these shoes today .
these are called all star chuck taylors .
they were about forty dollars .
she's one of the prettiest girls at the school .
well , she's quite short .
i would say she's only 5 feet .
she has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful .
have you seen her ?
would you like to order anything else ?
our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ?
she doesn't appear to be headed this way , so i will go get the check .
our total for dinner is $ 36 . 00 .
i kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received .
i believe that 10 % is just about right amount .
have you seen the new girl in school ?
she's not too tall .
she's about 5 feet even .
she has pretty light brown eyes .
so you have seen her around ?
i absolutely love what you're wearing today .
seriously , it looks really nice on you . where did you buy it from ?
i really like that outfit .
thank you . i just bought these new shoes earlier today .
these are some chucks .
i got them for forty .
i think that you look very cute today .
what store did you get it from ?
i love your outfit right now .
thanks . i found these new shoes earlier at the store .
they only cost me about forty dollars .
she's kind of short .
she's probably about five feet .
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
did you go to school today ?
that's a switch .
no , i haven't . why ?
so go then .
well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ?
did you make it to school today ?
no , i didn't .
that was an odd change of subject .
no , not recently .
what's stopping you then ?
so , will you be at school tomorrow ?
hey , did you hear about jessica's party this weekend ?
oh really ? she gave me mine earlier today .
yeah , so are you planning on going ?
it really does , i can't wait .
it starts at 8 o'clock .
i'm not sure , but i don't think she's given out that many .
did you even bother to go to school today ?
no , but that was a random change of subject .
i haven't lately .
so then , why don't you just go ?
okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ?

not many but these ones . they are the folk antique handicrafts and collectibles exhibition halls !
okey , okey . we'll start from the folk collection exhibition house , a multi folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . the hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late king dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there .
if you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the butterfly exhibition . mr . chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . quite a lot of them are state level treasures .
good idea ! i've heard that the expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , tv , street signs , etc .
what's interesting to see there ?
i visited the first international flower festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers !
it would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park !
what's the matter , sir ? you look pale .
that's right . it's normal if you don't often take the plane . just relax a little bit .
don't worry , sir . it's just because of the lower pressure .
you may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
are you feeling better now ? do you need some pills ?
so , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well .
if you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . so please try to sleep , and have meals according to los angeles's time .

yes , but not too stiff , right ?
there are a few spots on it . i am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . dry cleaning usually takes three days .

by the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday .
the laundry has sewed on a new button for you .
i am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others .

you got lost . you're kidding !
you could have called .
you've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
i don't know . where ?
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
hmm , maybe i do .
maybe i have an idea how it happened .
you were too busy looking at joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
yes , that's what i think . maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries , you'll get lost for even longer . maybe six hours or so .
what ?
hah , hah ! see ? i guessed right . you weren't watching the road at all .
what can i do for you , sir ?
yes , i see . five thirty am mr . green , room 1021 .
ok , could you tell me your room number and your name ?
and when would you want us call you this time ?

you must be pretty excited about your trip to europe . when is it that you are leaving ?
like what ?
you are not going to give it up , are you ?
i don ’ t blame you . perhaps you could sublet it .
mmm . let me think . oh , i know just a person . an old colleague of mine , jim thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from june to august .
tell you what , i ’ ll be calling jim late this week anyway , so i ’ ll mention it to him then .
i need to know why i'm being charged $ 10 for a movie that i never ordered .
monday night ? monday night i was at a great concert .
thank you . it's very nice when problems can be solved quickly .
are you crazy ? you made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ?
why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything i have ?
can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to ?
my date is quite sophisticated . she would expect nothing less than the best .
that's a good idea , except i want to go out , not stay in . something else , maybe ?
that sounds good ! could you call them to see if i can get a reservation ?
i need a suggestion for a restaurant here in manhattan .
my date's very sophisticated , so i'm sure she would expect nothing but the best .
no , thank you , i want to go out on the town . what other ideas do you have ?
that sounds like a good place to take a date . can you make a reservation for me ?
could i order dinner ?
i want a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
that's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay .
not tonight , thank you .
charge it to whatever account you like .
hi , i need broadband for my computer .
go ahead . i'm all ears .
that's great ! how much is it ?
okay . what about the other alternatives ?
yes , that's the ticket ! and if i need to print something there ?
could you bring me some food , please ?
can i have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ?
oh , no filet ? okay , porterhouse will be fine then .
not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion .
no problem .
i'd like you to bring me some food .
please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
sure , i love porterhouse , too .
i'd love to , but i'm allergic to strawberries .
go right ahead .
uh oh ! i can't use ethernet . my computer is wireless only .
any alternative that works will be great .
that sounds good . what's the charge ?
that sounds good . now , how about the other alternatives ?
use my laptop in the lobby ? that's great ! now , if i need to print something there ?
hi . i can't get going on my computer until i get a broadband hookup .
that would be okay if i had an ethernet port . unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only .
anything to get me up and running .
that's fine . now tell me about the other alternatives .
i need something to eat , please .
i feel like champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
well , i prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too .
that's fine .
hello ! how do i get online with my laptop ?
yes , i'd love to hear what the alternatives are .
great ! but is it free ?
you said there were other alternatives ?
okay . that sounds like a winner . now if i need to print something in the lobby ?
i'd like to order dinner .
i'd like to order a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
i'd prefer the filet , but the porterhouse will do .
normally , i would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight .
that's fine .
i need to copy a document immediately .
great ! how much is it for a copy ?
that sounds reasonable . i'll be down there immediately .
a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot .
sure ! right now , i would even eat hamburger !
thank you , but i just finished eating some chocolate covered cherries .
not a problem .
oh , no ! i've got all i need for my stay here .
i need souvenirs !
yes , yes . souvenirs .
you know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo .
no , i still have plenty left , even if i took three baths a day .
i need to take home some souvenirs !
yes , souvenirs that i can take home and add to my collection .
are you kidding ? whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ?
hello ! how do i get more amenities ?
i'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
no , no . i've got plenty left .
what am i going to do about souvenirs ?
yes , i've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
please ! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
hi , i need to copy something right now .
okay , i'll be down there shortly .
i need some more amenities , please .
specifically , i'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo .
no , i'm not even halfway through my supply .
what's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ?
there you go . my friends expect me to bring home souvenirs .
i'd like to request some more amenities .
well , the free stuff ! you know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc .
not at all . i still have enough for the next few days .
i need some to keep as souvenirs !
yes , souvenirs . trinkets to remember my trip by !
oh , that's not the same . i never pay for hotel souvenirs !
hello ! i need to make a copy of something at once .
fantastic ! is there a charge ?
well , i'm only making one copy , so i guess i can afford it .
hi , can you tell me where i could make a copy of a document right now ?
that's great . i don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests ?
in the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . i'll be right down .
thanks .
well , except for one night , i enjoyed the hotel . and i loved new york , of course .
i am checking out . here is the key to my room .
thanks .
this hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in new york was thoroughly delightful .
hi , i'm out of here . here's my key .
thank you .
i only had nine little problems here . other than that , i enjoyed my stay , and i loved the city .
i need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible .
very good . how much does each copy cost ?
a dime ? i remember when copies used to cost a nickel .
this visit is over for me . here's your room key .
and thanks to you .
i'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches .
thank you very much .
well , most of my time here was pleasant . and new york itself is fantastic .
my stay is over . here's the key to my room .
many thanks .
this could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . the city itself is great .
thank you . i didn't think it would be this simple .
are you serious ? i have to pay $ 2 for a movie i never watched ?
this is outrageous ! i'm never coming back to this hotel again !
you guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that i never ordered or saw .
well , the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
i knew you'd see it my way .
am i in the twilight zone ? you're charging me for a movie i never saw ?
this is highway robbery . i've got a good mind to call the police !
i'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ?
she deserves nothing but the best , of course .
i promised her i would take her out to a restaurant . do you have another one in mind ?
great food and lots of patrons ? what more could i want ? please reserve a table for me .
i just discovered that i owe $ 10 for a movie that i never ordered .
thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .
you can
absolutely unbelievable ! you people should be ashamed of yourselves .
so , now i need your help again , if you don't mind . i'm taking a date to a restaurant .
she strikes me as being very sophisticated . only the best will do for her .
i don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . how about another restaurant ?
yes , that sounds like a winner . would you please call them to reserve a table ?
she will want an excellent restaurant , of course .
i wanted to go out somewhere , not stay here . do you know of another good restaurant ?
i like that ! could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ?
why am i being charged $ 10 for a movie that i never ordered ?
well , the file is wrong . i was at a great concert that night .
thank you for taking care of it so quickly .
well , now i've seen it all ! what a rip off this place is !
well , i've got a date . now i need to find a restaurant . can you help me ?
well , i sort of suggested that we would go out on the town . do you have another suggestion ?
gramercy tavern , eh ? i think i've heard of that before . call to get us a table , okay ?
i'm checking out in about half an hour .
great ! as you know however , the day in new york has hardly begun .
therefore , i think i'll explore new york some more . but i need to store my bags .
my luggage isn't enough of a deposit ?
well , then . let me put on my thinking cap for a moment .
i should tell you that i'm checking out in about 30 minutes .
very good ! now , it's still morning here in new york .
i'm going to spend some time exploring the city . what can i do with my luggage ?
a deposit ? isn't my luggage a deposit ?
okay . let me think about this .
do you know that i'm checking out in about 30 minutes ?
excellent ! now , as you know , the day has barely begun .
i want to hit a few more places in the city , but i need a place to put my luggage .
leave a deposit ? isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ?
hmm . i'll have to think about this for a second .
in case you didn't know , i'm checking out in half an hour .
that's good to hear . now there's still a whole new york day ahead of me .
i still have time to explore more of new york , but i need a place to secure my baggage .
a deposit , huh ? i would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit .
that deposit bothers me . give me a minute .
i'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes .
great ! as you know , however , the day in new york has hardly begun .
isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ?
it's always something , isn't it ? let me think about this for a second .
no , that won't be necessary . i just need a taxi .
just a taxi , please .
i'm going to rockefeller center .
i want to leave as soon as possible .
i need a taxi , please .
no , thanks . a taxi is just fine .
i don't want anything except a taxi , thank you .
rockefeller center .
great ! and remember , a taxi , not a limo .
i'm going to need a taxi .
a private vehicle , huh ? no , a taxi is okay .
no , i wouldn't be caught dead in a limo .
i'm headed to rockefeller center .
good , i'm leaving my room in about one minute .
thanks , but no thanks . a taxi will do just fine .
my destination is rockefeller center .

i see . and what's in this bag ?
i thought you said you didn't have any food with you today .
yes , we will have to dispose of them .

no , not today at least . enjoy your visit to the united states , mr . lee .
good afternoon ! trans pacific airline . how can i help you ?
what ’ s your name , please ?
please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
at the airport . ok , miss . wang , your flight 8 on july 19 from taipei to minneapolis is canceled . your new reservation is trans pacific flight 8 from taipei to minneapolis at 9 thirty a . m . on august 2 .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
hi , i would like to purchase a one way ticket to brussels , please .
how long does it take to get there ?
yeah , i think that is the best option . do you serve food on the train ? twelve hours is such a long time !
great ! i ’ ll take it .
this is the route i thought we could take on our hike on saturday afternoon .
it ’ s about six or seven miles . that ’ s about the kilometers .
right . then we turn left and walk up this small hill . the view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . we can eat a snack there .
yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting .
that ’ s right .
i think it will take about four hours , including breaks .
i'm glad we took the train . i don't like to ride in buses .
even in taiwan , i always liked to take the train . it is more comfortable .
look at that village !
do you think i can take a picture through this window ?
how long will it take us to drive to london ?
that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
no . let me take a look . it ’ s longer than my car .
wow ! that ’ s fast ! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
so , what do you plan to do today ?
did you buy tickets already ?
well , probably . probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
outside , on the sidewalk .
the myoma is very popular . there will be a lot of people .
oh , sorry . it stands for the museum of modern art . it's an acronym . m o m a myoma .
i suggest you go to the jewish museum . it ' s not far from the guggenheim , near central park . it is really very interesting . also , there is a great museum of medieval european art further up north . it ' s called the cloisters .
you can take a bus .
excuse me ? how can i get to the nearest branch of the national bank ?
how far up the street are the traffic lights ?
ok . so i turn right at the traffic lights . then ?
ok . where do i go then ?
welcome to adventure tours . how may i help you ?
well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . it ’ s the closest you can get to flying .
mmm . ok . well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? we have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge .
i have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey !
hello . excuse me . do you know if there's a commercial bank around here ?
thanks very much .
welcome to perfect getaway tours . how can i help you ?
very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend .
perfect ! this package includes round trip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger
of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard .
some places aren't good to go . but i can show you the right bus to take . it will be no problem .
i have never done that myself . but i hear it is very interesting . you two should go .
yes , but i'm very busy with work . and you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country .
it sure is hot . why don't we go in the haunted house ? at least it will be air conditioned .
well . maybe i'll go alone then . i really don't want to miss it .
it might take a long time . because there is a line , you know .
thanks .
i'm sorry it took so long .
hmm . let me try something . wait . i have a reservation for someone named sang here . but it's spelled j a n g . it's not spelled j i a n g . it's for a mr . c sang .
yes , sometimes it happens , ma'am . that's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . i'm sorry about the inconvenience .
yes , of course . the pool is open until 10:00 p . m . so you still have about 45 minutes .
here is your key . your room is 379 . you can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall . enjoy your stay , ma'am .
i hope the food here is good .
but the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here . if we are spending three days in hollywood , i want to see at least one star .
did you like the tour of universal studios ?
i thought it was great . didn't you like the special effects rooms ?
alice , it really was great . i think it was the most interesting thing here . you really should go in .
really . the special effects are fantastic . you shouldn't be scared . you would really enjoy it .
but this is maybe one of the best haunted houses in north america ! it's different .
i saw that in the guide . it looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture . do you want to go ?
alright , let's go then . how many tickets do we have left ?
i was only interested in the haunted house and the roller coaster rides . the other rides are for kids .
do you have a reservation ?
i'm sorry , ma'am . i can't find anything under that name . do you have your confirmation number ?
well , let me look again . how do you spell your first name , ma'am ?
i don't find a carol in the computer for today . i have a carol larson here . but that reservation is for next monday .
are you sure he used your name , ma'am ? maybe he reserved under his name .
i'm sorry . i have nothing here .
i'm glad i brought my jacket on this trip .
what would you like to do today ?
i don't agree . i think the capitol building is the most famous . but okay . if you want to see the white house , we'll go see it . i'm just afraid it will be boring .
excuse me , but i ’ m a bit lost here . where does this street lead to ?
but it's the white house . the president and his family live there . they won't let us see most of it . probably we can only see a couple of rooms .
hmm . if that's true , then the security there must be very good . because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the white house .
so i can't take my gun then .
yes , it's true i don't .
what ? do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ?
i'll be careful . don't worry . i don't want to get arrested by the fbi . but how long does the white house tour last ?
alright . we should take a taxi over there right after breakfast .
that's a good idea . do you want some more coffee ?
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
o . k . ticket , please .
would you like a window or an aisle seat , mr . smith ?

you must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after
the operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . but you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . if your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 .
it's nothing . did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ?

doctor , i slipped and fell on my way to school . the ground is so slippery from the snow . it seems i can't move my left arm now .

but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i'll have another prescription .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
oh , it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan , and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .

here's a twenty .
well , randy , i'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . the main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . i'll prescribe something for that throat .
some aspirin or panadol should help . you can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription .
hello , how are you today . here for your six month check up ?
oh , fine . let's take a look .
i have a terrible toothache .
( pointing ) this one here .
can you fill it ?
then i might as well have it out now .
what seems to be the trouble , mr . brown ?
oh , in what way ?
did you lose any weight ?
when was the last time you had a check up ?
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
you're just a little run down from overwork .
i think all you need is just a vacation .
what's wrong with you ? you look pale .
when did the trouble start ?
it sounds like you are coming down with the flu . let me take your temperature .
yes , thirty eight point seven . do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
now , let me have a look at you . i'd like to listen to your chest . now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it cough , now again . i want to examine your throat , too . open wide , say ' ah '
yes , it does look a bit sore . let's take an x ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
the tests showed nothing wrong . a slight viral infection .
i'm very worried , doctor . i'm afraid that i'm very ill .
because i feel tired all the time , even when i wake up in the morning . i find it very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite .
very badly , doctor .
well , yes , i am . i'm worried about my work . i've just taken a new job . i earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . i'm always afraid of making a mistake .
a guy in my office got the flu the other day . today i seem to have come down with it , too .
yes . i wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because i'll be on a business trip in two days .
but i'm going on a business trip in two days !
it all started the day before yesterday .
what should i do ?
have you got anything for diarrhea ?
i see . i'll follow your instructions .
what's wrong with you , young man ?
i see . you've got a cold .
take this medicine three times a day .
drink a lot of water and have a good rest . you'll be well soon .
what's wrong with you ?
how long has it been like this ?
i think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . it will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well .
when the result comes out , i will tell you about it . remember , never be afraid or be too tired .
now tell me , what's your problem ?
do you have a fever ?
certainly not . take one of these white pills three times a day .
good morning .
what's the problem ?
how long have you had that problem ?
take the lift to the third floor and then go along until you see the sign on your right .
well , open your mouth and let me have a look . it is nothing serious . you haven't got a fever . but you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . when you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . and eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath .

i'm quite upset ! i want a new room and a refund for tonight .
thank you . i didn't want to have to take this to court .

paranoid ? i ’ m not paranoid ! i ’ m cautious ! you see dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! people just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! they have way too much information ! i like to keep everything on a need to know basis .
good afternoon , chloe , i ’ m doctor evans . what seems to be the problem ?

let ’ s see . okay , so 50 mg of prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?
okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day . be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol !
okay , anything else i can get you ?
sure . darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system .
are you okay , man ? you don ’ t look very well .
nice ! so , where did you guys go ?
oh no ! mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !
is that why you missed work today ?

too bad man , tonight is tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go .
hey , gary , great to see you again . please have a seat . so tell me , what seems to be the problem ?
excuse me . i need to refill this prescription .
yes , i need to refill it today .
i was worried about that . i couldn't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . so i can't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i'll have another prescription .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
oh , it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan , and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
let me have a look . whoa ! get away from me !
i think you have chicken pox ! you are contagious ! get away ! don ’ t breathe on me !
well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! i didn ’ t get it when i was a kid and i ’ ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !

let's shake on it .

mr . chang , i just want to tell you that we are leaving london for beijing by flight cp 645 on saturday morning . could you meet us at the airport , please ?
i will say it again . do you hear me now ?
i ’ m going to the beauty parlor . do you want to come too ?
good idea . we should also get pedicures and manicures .
i think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don ’ t you agree ?
maybe we should try a thai massage too .
that ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet .
look , bob hasn't made any progress on that project .
we should have a word with him .
what is that plastic cup for ?
am i supposed to pee into the cup ?
then what do i do with the cup ?
when will i know the results ?
hi bob , i won't be in work tomorrow .
i have a dentist appointment .
what am i supposed to do with this plastic cup ?
how , exactly , does this work ?
when i finish , what should i do then ?
will i know the results right away ?
why are you handing me a plastic cup ?
how am i supposed to do that ?
what am i supposed to do with the cup when i am done ?
what kind of test is this ?
how long will it take to get the results ?
so , basically , i am ok ?
what will i learn when i see the results on the website ?
are all of my test results on that site ?
what is available ?
are there many side effects ?
is that the only medication i need to take ?
what are the side effects of that drug ?
can you help me find a lotion for a problem i am having ?
i have poison oak , and i need help with the rash that won ’ t stop itching .
which one is best ?
can i do anything else to help with the itching ?
hello , could you tell me my test results ?
are you saying that all my results were normal ?
how will i know what the results mean on the website ?
will the numbers mean anything to me ?
can i see all of my test results at once ?
hi , i think i was supposed to call for my test results today .
are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ?
will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
how will i know what the numbers mean ?
how can i see test results from tests i have taken before ?
what types of drugs can i try ?
what about side effects from that medication ?
do i only need to take that one drug ?
what can i expect when i take that medication ?
what is this test for ?
what does that tell him ?
will the blood test hurt ?
ouch !
what about a medication to help me with my problem ?
what types of medications would be best ?
what are the side effects from taking that drug ,
will that one medication take care of all of my problems ?
am i going to experience any complications with that drug ?
my doctor says that i need a blood test .
what are you taking my blood for ?
is a blood test painful ?
oh , my god , that hurts !
have you been having any problems lately ?
do you have a history of high blood pressure ?
high blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms .
we are going to use this cuff here , and it will give me a reading .
they tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood .
i came to this lab to have my blood drawn .
what am i being tested for ?
what does my white blood cell count tell him ?
how much will it hurt ?
is that my blood going into that tube ?
how have you been feeling lately ?
has your blood pressure been high before ?
usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer .
i am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading .
i get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest .
hi , what brings you to my office today ?
have you had the flu lately ?
does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ?
i feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma .
hello , how are you doing today ?
have you had any type of cold lately ?
do you have any allergies that you know of ?
does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
i am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
have you been feeling ok lately ?
has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ?
people with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer .
we will pump air into this cuff to get a reading .
it tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest .
good morning , how have you been doing ?
have you had any type of bug lately ?
has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ?
does this happen more when you are under stress ?
i am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
do you have any friend you would call really close ones ?
what kind of people would you like to work with ?
what kind of people you find hard to work with ?
bob , what are you thinking about ?
do you think it'll work ?
doctor , i have the worst toothache !
for about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
you know , i was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and i accidentally bit down really hard on one .
i just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
can you work over tonight ?
okay , i'll ask bob to cover it .
i thought about what you said .
i decided that you're right .
hello , bob . can you give me an update of the situation ?
is everything under control ?
is it okay to have a day off next week ?
i need to go to the dentist .
i'm going to let bob know about the merger .
why ?
i'm tired .
sorry , mary , i can't make it in time for dinner .
maybe i will be around later .
yes , once last week .
maybe you should have told me first ?
because we're partners .
may i help you ?
he's in a meeting with phil .
what is this for ?
okay , thanks .
he's been late for work twice .
john , do you have a minute ?
well , i ’ ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m getting at . we ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . a lot people are going in and out .
no , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to .
oh , that would be too small .
come to think of it , you may be on to something . let ’ s go have a look .
mrs . phoebe , here are your ordered goods . please inspect the goods now .
our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . it is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . it is the basement for the future cooperation .
of course , let me help you .
you know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
hello , green trading company . what can i do for you ?
yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon .
didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ?
how about friday afternoon ?
kim , have you made contact with mr . lee ?
what seems to be the problem ?
maybe his phone is out of order . anyway , keep working on it . i really need an answer about the contract i sent him .
linda , it's really late . let's call it a day .
sure thing . do you want me to give you a ride home ?
don't mention it . it ’ s my pleasure .
mrs . lee , i ’ ve stayed here for almost a week . and i really must leave tomorrow .
thank you . you ’ ve been so nice to me .
no , thanks . you ’ ve done a lot for me already . thank you for everything .
oh , this is monica
yes . let's first define the inspection right .
would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ?
and can you tell me about the re inspection ?
i see . how do they make testing and analysis of this item ?
what if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ?
i've been working hard for a whole year . i really need a break .
later this month . i can't wait !
your pc is so amazing . are you doing trade on internet ?
i'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet .
oh , really ? is it a good way ?
what advantages does it have ?
i agree with you . it will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition .
so cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time .
will you give me some suggestion ?
mr . wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ?
we ’ ve all enjoyed being with you . when will you come back ?
i ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . take care .
i heard you were promoted to general manager of ibm ’ s china head quarters .
you did a good job for the company . so , this is your first day in the new position . how do you feel ?
i believe you are cut out for this position .
hello , fred . what are you doing ?
can you tell me the concept of e commerce ? now , many people mentioned the word , ' e commerce ' , in front of me .
what kinds of channels can you use in e commerce ?
your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . we have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent .
i'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . your garments are attractive , and we , a well established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales .
we supply washers of all types and sizes . we have years of experience in the manufacture of washers .
sure , we do .
mr . smith , i would like to get right to the point here . first , we need to talk about how much each company will pay .
let's look at that another way . the major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger .
this is our best product .
they'll be done before the end of the week .
have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ?
i'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
i'm afraid not . we insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up .
do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail ?
how should i take this medication ?
should i avoid alcohol with this medication ?
should i expect any side effects ?
when should i take this medication ?
should i take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
what are the side effects of this medication ?
excuse me , could you help me pick out a lotion ?
i got poison oak while hiking , and i need something to help me with the itching .

how have you been doing ?
how long have you had this toothache ?

i came here to get a chest x ray .
what comes next ?
is this ok ?
how come you are walking away ?
will i be finished then ?
you look kind of green .
have you had anything to eat lately ?
perhaps the food was bad .
do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ?
are you feeling ok ?
perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around .
my doctor said that i need a chest x ray .
what should i do after that ?
am i standing the right way ?
is that all there is to it ?
you don ’ t look so good .
maybe you have food poisoning .
are you under a lot of stress ?
maybe you have a touch of the flu .
did you take any cold medication ?
i think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold .
a pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work .
i know that it ’ s going around the dorms .
i have some cold tablets if you would like one .
drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold .
you could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions .
can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?
i need to excise my arms too . how can i do that ?
when i do push ups , should i bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?
what ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?
so i need plenty of space for this exercise .
what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ?
perhaps you ’ ve been working too hard . you do have a high pressure job .
well . i ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good .
good morning . what seems to be the problem ?
i ’ d say you ’ ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . have you been taking anything for your cold ?
good . i ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . it will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest .
have you been working hard recently ?
good . let ’ s take a look at that rash . it looks worse than it is . i ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . if the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . do you have any other sy
don ’ t worry about that . it ’ s probably of the stress you ’ ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn ’ t work or use an
billy , you don ’ t look too well . maybe you should take the day off school .
you ’ ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . what ’ s that on your arm ?
does it hurt ?
here . put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . i ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
that's nice . i'd like to give it a try . i think i like passion red . please .
no .
how long will it take to get them dry ?
have you seen bill recently ?
daisy ’ s in hospital too . she got food poisoning last week . she thinks she got it from some bad seafood .
he ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . he probably just had a cold .
i see . my niece just flew back from australia to visit . she ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow .
oh , your hand is still sore . you should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling .
which would you recommend ?
what does it included ?
does it include facial mask and massage ?
will it exfoliate the skin as well ?
could i have my hair dyed ?
i want the latest fashion , can you make some suggestions ?
oh , no . i think it's better to be a natural chinese , with natural chinese hair . have you got good brand of hair dye ?
i want the best one .
after this dye job , it feels i look younger .
can i see him please , mrs williams ?
you look very well , jimmy . you are better now , but you mustn't get up yet . you must stay in bed for another two days . the boy mustn't go to school yet , mrs williams . and he mustn't eat rich food .
no , he doesn ’ t .
verry sorry to have kept you waiting so long . what do you want , madam ?
how long would you like your haircut today ?
you wanna tight , medium or naturally curly perm ?
how about you hair style ?
well , with perm we can do very kinds patterns such as bob , chocolate hairstyle or bang . which do you prefer ?
it looks wonderful .
what do you think of it ?
good morning , mr croft .
do you have an appointment ?
is it urgent ?
the dentist is very busy at the moment . can you come at 2 pm ?
i'm afraid that he can't , mr croft . can't you wait till this afternoon ?
what's wrong with you ?
do you feel tired ?
i'm sorry to hear that . i'll have to examine you .
well , what is your trouble ?
have you any aches and pains ?
i'll take your temperature . how long have you been feeling ill ?
you have a temperature , but it's nothing serious . it's probably just the flu . i'll give you a prescription . take this to the chemist's . take one tablet every four hours . you should stay in bed tom
hi benjamin . my name is dr . green . what seems to be the matter ?
what are your symptoms ?
it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . do you feel thirsty most of the day ?
have you been drinking plenty of water ?
ok . well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . first , let me feel your pulse .
i see . i'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . the burse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . you should hear from us
ow !
yes , i have . i think that i've hurt my back .
i'm sorry , lucy . i'm afraid that i can't get up .
sorry sir . but you can ’ t go into the or .
it was touching girl for a while .
she will be ok . she is a tough cookie .
in my opinion she will up about soon .
i believe it . well , i ’ ve got to go back in .
all right . just relax , ok ? go and got a cup of coffee .
hi , mr . smith . i'm doctor hawkins . why are you here today ?
yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . you should have one every year .
well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . so try to come at least once a year for your own good .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath , please . do you smoke , mr . smith ?
smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . you really should quit .
well , we have classes and some medications that might help . i'll give you more information before you leave .
what is the matter with you ?
how long have you been like this ?
i think you've got a flu . take this prescription to the chemist's and then go back and sleep .
don't worry about your flu . you will be ok soon .
i feel chilly and i've got a pain in my abdomen .
what should i do ?
you don't look well at all . are you sick ?
i see . you've caught a bad cold . i'll give you a prescription .
your english has really improved in the two months you've been here , too .
what is your temperature now ?
how high was your temperature yesterday ?
will you open your mouth ? your throat is swollen .
lily ! why aren't you up and ready for school ?
lily , if you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky .
you two are so health conscious !
why not ! before you know it , i'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head !
thanks for the carrot juice , mrs . schmidt . i've got to run to class !
what seems to be the problem ?
let ’ s have a look . mmmm . this doesn ’ t look too good . i think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . it ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain .
first we will take some x rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . i also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling .
mmm .
hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
you're right . too much or too little won't do any good .
sounds reasonable .
and fruits !
i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ?
what are they ?
why ?
that makes sense . probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper .
what's that ?
wow ! no wonder people are so fat . say , carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising .
you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise .
so what happened ?
you hoo , anybody here ?
no way . alisan darling just got hitched in vagas .
ya . and now i can break this to you . fanny is moving .
well i have to go , rock sam . you take it easy , ok .
good morning ! marquette general hospital . tia speaking . may i help you ?
your medical card no . , please ?
thanks . do you have an appointment , ms . wang ?
what is the matter ?
have you taken your temperature ?
anything else bothering you ?
well , you can come to a work in clinic today . you do not need an appointment .
any time between 8 a . m . to 9 p . m .
you are very welcome . anything else i can do for you today ?
good afternoon , madam . how can i help you ?
first of all , we'll tailor a work out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs .
well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work out plan .
since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
wise decision . that is 400 yuan . you'll find it's totally worth it .

i can , but i'm not going to . you don't need medicine . you need advice . don't work so hard . too much work is bad for you . don't worry about your work . it ' s silly to worry . take regular exercise .
then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . which would you rather have , health or wealth ?

show me your torgue . what did you eat yesterday ?

young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening .
i see ! how many pieces of cake did you eat ?
how many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ?
right . just take off your jacket and shirt . and lie down on that bed over there . that's right . now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? . does this hurt ?
and this ?
and do you feel anything when i do this ?
and you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? in you legs , for example ?
what seems to be the problem ?
let ’ s have a look . mmmm . this doesn ’ t look too good . i think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . it ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain
first we will take some x rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . i also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling .

professor , excuse me , but i need to leave early .
i am not feeling well .
i think i am beginning to have an asthma attack .
no , i think that i should just go home because i have some medicine there .
i live in the dorms across the street , so i ’ ll be ok .
do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ?
what time do you usually go to bed ?
have you been under a lot of stress lately ?
have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ?
i just feel funny .
i have a terrible headache .
i already have some medicine at home if i could just get there .
thank you , but the bus stops right at my house .
how have you been doing lately ?
is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ?
when do you turn in for the night ?
do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ?
do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ?
has everything been ok with you lately ?
how late do you try to go to sleep ?
has anything in your day to day life been bothering you lately ?
you might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head .
i have been having a lot of headaches lately .
i have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately .
i ’ ve been under stress , but no more than usual .
no , i only sleep a few hours a night .
yes , actually i fell skiing last week and hit my head .
hi , i was wondering if i could get my test results from the other day .
is something wrong with me ?
can we talk about it now ?
when can i come and see you ?
hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day .
does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
can ’ t you just tell me now ?
i want to see you right away .
i know for sure that something is wrong !
i have been getting headaches almost every day lately .
i never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks i have been getting a lot of them .
my mother just passed away last tuesday .
i have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority .
no , i haven ’ t hit my head .
hi , the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today .
i think that this is a bad sign .
why wouldn ’ t you tell me over the phone ?
you are scaring me !
i have had some really horrible headaches lately .
i get headaches occasionally , but they have been really bad lately .
i am getting ready to take my gre .
it has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache .
i hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago .
i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts !
i'm lucky i wasn't killed . i must have been going around forty five miles an hour . there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out .
make it tighter . i want the blood stopped . then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk .
steve schliessman . s c h l i e s s m a n .
349 95 8821 .
yes , i do . blue cross .
no , i don't .
can i sit down now ?
excuse me . i need to refill this prescription .
yes , i need to refill it today .
i was worried about that . i couldn't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . so i can't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i've run out . can you just refill it once more ?
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i'll have another prescription .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
oh , it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan , and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
good morning , how are you doing today ?
so , i can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical .
we are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose .
yes , i will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later .
we will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count .
i need help . i think my arm is broken .
no , i haven't . i need help quick . it hurts really badly .
let me see a doctor .
no . only a little . i fell off my porch .
my left arm .
no , i can't . i'm left handed .
yes . but why do i have to fill out a form anyway ? this is the emergency room .
hi , mr . smith . i ’ m dr . hawkins . why are you here today ?
yes , well you haven ’ t had one for . five years . you should have one every year .
well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . so , try to come at least once a year for your own good .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath , please . do you smoke , mr . smith ?
smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . you really should quit .
well , we have classes and some medications that might help . i ’ ll give you more information before you leave .
ah ! it hurts . don't touch it .
the shoulder .
it's not a cut . it's a gash ! it's bigger than a cut ! ah ! i need a doctor .
i'm bleeding too much .
yes . my bike has one under the seat . get it , quick !
wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . that will work as a tourniquet . after that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .
no , forget that ! do the tourniquet first . i'm losing too much blood .
my wife is in labor !
thanks . sorry . it just came as such a surprise . the baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks .
about fifteen minutes .
yes .
i ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
the pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
the fourth . i ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
sir . sir ? are you all right ? sir ?
oh , no . he ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . call 911 .
can you tell me where it hurts ?

we are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
what seems to be the problem ?
where does it hurt the most ?
how long has it felt like this ?

no , but i have a low fever .
i want to come in on wednesday .
i would prefer dr . smith .
i am sorry , but i cannot stay for the rest of class today .
i feel as if i am going to be sick to my stomach .
i have some medicine at home that i could take .
thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
hi , i have a doctor ’ s appointment scheduled with dr . smith , and i need to change it .
my appointment was on tuesday .
it was for two o ’ clock in the afternoon .
i would like to switch it to next friday .
i would like to come in at 10
good afternoon , chloe , i ’ m doctor evans . what seems to be the problem ?
ah i see , yes you do sound rather croaky . well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” .
good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . how are your ears , blocked at all ?
ok chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while i listen to your chest ? you really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . ok , i ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . you will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . you will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . finally , i am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs !
absolutely not ! you are highly contagious ! you don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co workers do you ? i recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . you can catch up on all the latest tv shows and movies !
ha ha , sure not a problem ! here you are . now off you go and away to bed . if you have any questions just give me a call ! feel better soon and take care .
good morning , i made an appointment with dr . smith , but i have to change it .
my appointment was on wednesday .
it was for 4
i want to change to next tuesday .
i would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
let me see a doctor .
i thought this was the emergency room .
my left arm .
no , i can't . i'm left handed .
yes . but why do i have to fill out a form anyway ? this is the emergency room .
no . just let me see a doctor . i'm worried about my arm .
steve schliessman . s c h l i e s s m a n .
yes , i do . blue cross .
no , i don't .
what are you doing ?
come on ! stop being so vain . you look great ! you are beautiful !
i don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! you are 25 , stop being ridiculous . besides , i think that people who get boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . it doesn ’ t look natural .
i think you need to get brain surgery . i honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . you look amazing .
you don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . you are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! plus , plastic surgery hurts !
hello , i scheduled an appointment with dr . smith , and i can ’ t make it on that day .
my appointment was on monday .
it was for 10
i would prefer next thursday .
i want to come in at 2
sounds like you may be far sighted . ok , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
wow , arthur ! you ’ re as blind as a bat !
have you been registered yet , sir ?
are you a medical or surgical case ?
please fill in this admission card . well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ?
but there're no beds available now . two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then .
hello sir , how can i help you ?
let ’ s see . okay , so 50 mg of prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?
okay , anything else i can get you ?
sure . darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system .
hello , arthur . what seems to be the problem ?
sounds like you may be far sighted . ok , then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
wow , arthur ! you ’ re as blind as a bat !
ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while i fill out your prescription .
hey , gary , great to see you again . please have a seat . so tell me , what seems to be the problem ?
well , let ’ s have a look . open wide . hmm . this doesn ’ t look good . well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . we ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . i ’ m going to order some x rays .
no , not at all ! just lay back and relax .
please point out the painful place with your finger . is there any relation between the pain and the weather ?
have you ever had any trauma ?
does the pian become more intense at night ?
do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ?
i'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree .
acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . we'll try it every day for seven days . will that be all right ?
do you think i can get back to work very soon ?
is there anything i should do ?
should i take some medicine ?
what if it's broken ?
what do you mean by a cast ?
recently i have been getting headache and my eyes come to see focus properly .
two years ago . at that time i had no problems . now i can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .
well , this one is worse .
good morning , doctor . i've been suffering very much from a toothache lately .
i think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble .
oh , i hate having teeth pulled out . will it hurt ?
is it out ?
i often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat .
yes . sometimes i can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . and i often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
it has been seasonal during these past three years .
yes , things like seafood and penicillin type drugs .
what useful treatment can you offer ?
what seems to be the problem ?
has this been a problem before ?
for how long ?
do you only feel this way when you stomach is empty ?
do you have regular bowel movements ?
let me take a look at your abdomen . lie down on your back and bend your knees up . ok . relax . alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before i can be certain . you should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much .
what's the problem ?
let me have a look . how did this happen ?
was there much bleeding afterward ?
yes . three , i think . it wont ' be too painful . alright , we're done . that wasn't so bad , was it ?
you're lucky there was no lasting damage . i'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . we'll take those stitches out then . so long .
how long have you been like that ?
let me have a look at your throat first . please open your mouth and say ah .
and show me your tongue . thank you . that'll do . you have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . how is your appetite ?
do i have a temperature , doctor ?
could you make up this prescription for me , please ?
great . i'll take this brand . and how do i take these medicines ?
thank you .
billy , you don ’ t look too well . maybe you should take the day off school .
you ’ ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . what ’ s that on your arm ?
it ’ s a rash . i ’ d better take you to see the doctor . how did you get that bruise on your leg ?
here . put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . i ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
can i help you , sir ?
i'm sorry . all the appointments are filled .
let me see . perhaps i could fit you in at five thirty .
what about tomorrow morning , then ?
i guess it can't be helped .
all right , then . see you this afternoon .
here you are .
no , i'll e paying for myself , but i have private medical insurance .
thanks a lot .
good morning . what can i do for you ?
do you have a registration card ?
then you need to register as a new patient . can i have a look at you id card ? i need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number .
thanks . which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional chinese medicine ?
i have a terrible toothache .
this one here .
can you fill it ?
then i might as well have it done now .
dental clinic . this is mr . adams .
all right , david . is this for a checkup or a cleaning ?
what tooth is giving you pain ?
good morning . what seems to be the problem ?
i ’ d say you ’ ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . have you been taking anything for your cold ?
good . i ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . it will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest .
have you been working hard recently ?
good . let ’ s take a look at that rash . it looks worse than it is . i ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . if the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . do you have any other symptoms ?
don ’ t worry about that . it ’ s probably of the stress you ’ ve been under . just take some aspirin . combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . you shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . if i were you , i ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch tv . here is your prescription .
oath , i think i broke my leg .
thanks .
all right .
john taylor , 32 , may 23 , 1970 .
i don ’ t have it .
i don ’ t have health insurance .
what wrong with you ? you look pale ?
when did the trouble start ?
it sounds like you ’ re coming down with the flu . let me take your temperature .
yes . thirty eight point seven . do you have a headache , chestache or throat pain ?
now , let me have a look at you . i ’ d like to listen to your chest . breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . cough , now again . i want to exam your throat too . open wide , say a .
yes , it does look a bit sore . let ’ s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests .
what seems to the trouble mr brown ?
oh , in what way .
when was the last time you have track up ?
let me take your blood pressure . you look anilic . well , mr . brown . i ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious . you just a little run down from overwork .
i think you ’ ll needs just vacation . try to get out doors more . i ’ ll be sure if you get more rest .
good morning , doctor !
i am not feeling very well . i've got a bad cold .
no , but i've got a headache .
well , mr . smith . that's a nasty infection you have .
the fourth . i'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
oh , i think i broke my leg .
thanks .
all right .
james taylor , 23 , march 30 , 1982 .
i don't have it .
i don't have health insurance .
hello , doctor .
it's nothing serious actually , doctor . it ’ s . well , i get tired very easily recently , and i often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while i'm dining .
about two months . i didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , i got fired this morning . i dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . i was very embarrassed .
pretty good , i'd say .
no , doctor . i've actually put on two pounds .
well , doctor ?
what examinations ?
sir , i am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . it is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . we are beginning to get more attention from overseas .
ok , let me see . i suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products .
ok , i'll take a message .
mr . wilson . we very regret the mistakes in goods . i am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake .
the first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . about the second problem , i admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample .
how about overtime work ?
do you like regular work ?
good morning . this is apple corporation . may i speak to ballam ?
i ’ m calling to offer you the position of computer engineer .
your starting salary is 3 , 000 yuan a month , but if you work well we will put you on our regular staff after six months time and your salary will be raised to 5 , 000 yuan a month .
what is the lowest salary you may consider ?
that ’ s all right . we will pay you 4 , 000 yuan a month for supporting your family . would you like to start on next monday ?
i'm mary kell . may i ask your name ?
i'm glad to meet you , mr . zhuang . sit down , please .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
your typing and stenography are pretty good . would you be interested in applying for the job ?
what's wrong with you ?
well , maybe the net is slow now . try it again .
it's beyond question . you can save it the same as a document .
it's the same as usual . the only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment .
there are limitations to the capacity of an e mail . commonly it's no more than 4 mb .
hello , westhaven company .
this is michael richard speaking . who is calling ?
you gave me a deep impression then . can i help you ?
we have made the decision to hire you .
what post have you held before ?
hello , could you please connect me to mr . cook's office ? it is on line three .
oh . then i don't know what his number is . can you check it for me ?
ok . thank you .
thank you . you helped me a lot .
good luck to you , good bye .
can i talk to you for a moment , manager ?
i've decided to leave .
i've worked here for two years . and i want to do something different .
i want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language .
i fired mr . li today .
. so what i think we need to do is ( xxxxxxxxxx ) finish on time .
oh , ok , i said ( xxxxxxxxxx ) on time .
( xxxxxxxxxx )
( xxxxxxxxxx ) but i don ’ t think you can hear us . ( xxxxxxxxxx ) hello ? ( xxxxxxxxxx )
we have received your resume in answer to our ads . i would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , ok ?
what is your greatest weakness ?
what is the greatest disappointment in your life ?
well done ! another question ! when will you start work , if you are hired ?
what price do you suggest for 300 , 000 sets of article no . 2323 with london as the destination port ?
what commission terms can you offer ?
couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ?
good morning , janice . our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so i will allocate you some assignment .
don't worry . i will find someone to assist you .
firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . here is the list of things you need to buy .
the meeting room on the fourth floor needs to be swept . jerry and tom will help you at that time . any questions ?
don't worry about that . i have already calculated the money about things you will buy . remember to give me the receipt when you come back .
our benefits usually include medical insurance , public accumulation fund and allowances .
if you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . it is 200 yuan per day .
as a new comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . and remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave .
now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . please sit down .
well . i have nearly forgotten . mr green from abc company had an appointment with me , but i will be very busy at that time . if he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week .
can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ?
yes , mainly prints . there are a few plain as well . here they are .
200 rolls of each . make it 200 rolls for each sample .
twenty prints and five plain . that makes 5 , 000 rolls in all .
yes , five to six weeks .
eight weeks ? we can wait that long .
that's right .
as soon as i hear from beijing , that will be either friday or saturday .
these goods can be broken very easily , so we would be thankful if you would be sure to use durable packing materials .
good . can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ?
do you always put a quality mark on each container ? for this shipment it is crucial to us that you do .
what kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ?
in that case , i guess i can rest assured .
you're right . but wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ?
it wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? let's still use cartons .
could i have a word with you , madam ?
i feel sick and coughed a lot at night .
yes , i did this in the morning . and my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days .
i hope so . and i will definitely tell you if i can not .
let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms .
i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . can't you give us d / a or d / p ?
but on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of l / c payment for our imports . and there is the licensing problem .
can you effect shipment during september ?
then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ?
it's too late . you see , in our market october is the season for the kind of commodity . so the goods must be shipped before october or we won't be ready for the season .
thanks . then may i suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on september 15 or earlier ' ?
sir , i want to ask for a leave for five days . here is the request form .
yes , i need to go home to have a family reunion .
yes , sir . i remember it . but our chinese usually celebrate the new year on lunar calendar .
well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment .
accepting time l / c is unusual and i've never done it before , but we could consider your request . i'll phone our company to see what they say .
what do you think about the equipment in our company ?
i also realized this issue . and office automation is essential .
good idea . a network of work stations is helpful for our management .
david , how is your interview ?
just fine . i tried to answer every question raised by hr carefully . i found some answering skills are useful . these questions are different from exams .
don't be rush . it is suggested to write a letter for the personnel department of future clothes company .
just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? i am going to receive some urgent fax from a company .
that's right .
i couldn't agree more .
what can i do next ?
look . some of the faxes come through blurred . what is wrong with it ?
how much tea are you going to order ?
when do you want to deliver the goods ?
i'm sorry , but june 30 is quite soon . i can't guarantee 1 500 cases , i'd prefer the first shipment to be 1 , 000 cases and the next 2 , 000 cases .
let me affirm this again the first shipment of 1 , 000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by june 30 , and the second shipment of 2 , 000 cases by august 15 . right ?
well , if there's nothing else , i think we've settled everything .
how are you doing ? pretty good , i imagine ?
ok , let me hear it . i'd be glad to help if i can .
well , i trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms .
but for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially .
in what way can we solve the problem ?
yes . but the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks .
i'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .
what about a draft at 120 days sight ?
a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
how many do you intend to order for our shirts ?
we are not interested in small orders . i suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen .
yes , of course . we have enough productivity . you can rest assured .
sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent .
we like your product , and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible .
that's all right . we will send you a purchase order in one week . i hope you will be able to take care of it .
thanks . we need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . by the way , will payment against delivery be ok ?
we will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here .
well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new i will listen to what you have to say .
i can't agree to that . my company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back .
you look bright eyed and bushy tailed .
congratulations ! let's get together sometime .
well , i am worried to death right now ! there is still no news from the company for me .
to start with , may i ask why you chose to work at our company ?
well , please look at the employment contract . i'd like to go over the main details again before signing . first , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved .
of course . a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract ?
steven , have a rest . could you have a talk with me ?
janice has just got sick and i need a hand now . could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ?
let me think . about half past seven if it is okay for you .
fred , is it a good time to talk with you ?
as you know , i have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but i am not sure i can do my work well . and right now my dilemma is that i can not find a person whom i can trust for these three programs .
we are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . so , to be honest , i want you to help me to finish all these programs .
i am aware you have been working so hard . before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this .
good morning . my name is penny white . i'm new here .
ok .
yes , that's ok . i'm glad to get started .
i have read your resume . what is your last job ?
could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ?
great ! could you tell me your educational background ?
why are you willing to work for our company ?
ok , that's all . we'll inform you in two days .
my pal , you are so nervous recently . you don't need to be like that .
just use your head . if you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed .
that is merely a dream . remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . i think we did the good job in the whole period .
in the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ?
how do you feel what you have done ? did you meet our goals ?
yes . and you also overworked in last month , when steven asked for leave . i have been very satisfied with your performance . and your dependability has been a great asset .
stephen , can you work overtime tonight ?
the holiday is coming so we need to finish our task .
yes . the contract must be kept .
did he say why ?
don't worry . i will tell him about that .
yes , of course . most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . another thing is that most travelers to the uk tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . this age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . they kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . they are not into mountain climbing in wales or anything .
just a moment . i'll tell you about that in a minute . where was i ? oh yes . by way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the uk for this kind of traveler over the last five years . if you look at page ten you can see what i mean . in spite of these characteristics of the market , i still think there is room for growth in the youth sector .
ok , let me tell you what we ’ ve been doing . we ’ ve been in touch with the wales and scottish tourist development offices here in taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . we ’ ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions .
go ahead .
well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . we haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it .
hello , pineapple computer company . this is janice shaw , the secretary of nova . may i ask who is calling ?
i feel so sorry that nova has gone on her business trip .
wait a minute . i have to leave a memo here . anything else ?
madam , what can i do for you ?
i get it . and . ?
how about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ?
ok , i will prepare it right now .
we should know by next month whom to hire . if your application is successful , we'll notify you by mail .
we'll give you our decision in 7 days .
please send the next candidate in on your way out .
janice , i can't find the document i was working on last month . can you help me to look for it ?
yes , but i still can not find it . maybe it is in this cabinet .
i am sure that document was filed .
good idea ! it seems that i asked you to put it in nova's files .
hello , my name is clark . may i speak to mr . allen , please ?
mr . allen , i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . may i ask why i was defeated ?
experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ?
maybe you could hire me on trial , if i ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go .
good morning , mr . zhang , this is jimmy calling from polaroid company .
i regret to tell you that the position of sales manager has gone to another person .
we really believe that you are a highly qualified person . but the other candidate has several years of related experiences .
i am afraid we are sticking to our choice .
ladies and gentlemen , dear mr . simpson . following the increasing communication between unity company and pineapple computer company , we established steady cooperation . and today we all here feel very proud and honored to have mr . simpson with us . mr . simpson is well known for his success and his career . so first of all , let me , on the behalf of all present here , extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest . now let's invite mr . simpson to give us his speech .
janice , the president of our company , mr smith , will invite two programmers to give us a lecture this afternoon . are all the members notified ?
is the room ready for the lecture now ?
excellent . how about the microphone and speaker ?
how would you seat them ?
hush ! the wall has ears , you know .
my boy . i give you my sympathy to you . however , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it .
it is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year .
george , i heard our eighth generation computer is appreciated by the guests . they intend to sign contract with our company . you have done a good job . we are so proud of you .
hah , as the sales department director , you are the best .
why not ? you've done so well for the company . she should give you a prize .
come on ! what are you nervous about ?
but the sales number is close to the predicted amount .
i'm afraid it's bad news for you . you haven't got the position .
i'm afraid so . i'm terribly sorry .
he's the only one of the several to decide this .
i don't think the thing can be that serious . you should face the result . besides , i don't think the position is the best for you .
bell computers limited , can i help you ?
hold on please .
yes , 123 456 789 , mary from happy travel . have you got that ?
great . thanks .
no , that's it . thanks . bye .
so awful ! i never fancy my salary is so little .
bingo ! i never thought about that before . i am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know .
i know i deserve it , but i can not find a way to talk with boss about this .
that sounds reasonable .
that's a point . it seems a little complicated . i will think about this for a while . i owe you one . after all , you give me an inspiration .
good afternoon , miss tao . please sit down .
i ’ ve read your application materials with interest . now i want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind .
the first is why you choose our company ?
why do you want to quit your present company ?
well , when do you think you can come over to work ?
why do you plan to change your job ?
why are you interested in working with this company ?
well , mr . cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ?
i see . but have you ever done any work in this field ?
why do you plan to change your job ?
if you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ?
janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ?
very good . what is the essence of filing , do you know ?
yes , ' one customer one file ' is essential . and remember to update them timely .
correct .
i've known from your resume that you are a college graduate .
what did you take as your major in college ?
what kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ?
all right , i see . why do you want to work for a sino american joint venture enterprise now ?
well , mr . zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things .
madam , is everything set up for your trip ?
you will be busier , right ?
that will be gorgeous !
well , if you have no further questions , then we have done .
you ’ re welcome . i appreciate your coming .
well , i really appreciate your coming today .
welcome to china , mr . smith .
great ! b , most of the items listed are available this year . i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
good idea ! in this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
good morning , sir . are you mr . wang , the personnel manager ?
ok . i ’ m 24 this year . i earned my college diploma from the night college of foreign languages institute in 2010 . my major is english . recently i ’ ve also earned my degree in secretarial technology .
of course . i ’ ve been working as an office clerk in the textile company since my graduation . i do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on .
to be frank , not very much , because i can ’ t use much what i ’ ve learned in my work . i enjoy doing more challenging work .
of course . first of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility .
she must be an honest person .
is this the first time you've come to our city , mr . ross ?
i am so honored to hear that . well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . we have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well known in the country . how about our cooperation ?
thank you for your interest in this job . you'll be hearing from us . send the next applicant in on your way out , please .
it has been pleasant talking with you .
may i call you at your home about our final decision ?
we'll get in touch with you by next wednesday . thank you for your interest in this job .
: how are you , mr . ding ? i ’ m john brown .
please have a seat . i know our employment officer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but i ’ d like to go over the main details again before signing the contract . first , you ’ ll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . no probation is involved .
you ’ ll be covered by our medical plan while on duty . since you ’ ll be middle anagement , you , re expected to be available up to one hour past normal working hours . any approved overtime that will be paid at time , which you can take as salary or time off .
a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract ?
yes it is , but you ’ ll have to discuss the details with your manager .
how can i help you , sir ?
do you have an appointment ?
i guess she forgot your meeting . she is attending an important meeting in the company . will you have a seat ? may i leave a memo for her ?
here i raise a question for you . just imagine we will have a foreign guest from japan . can you tell me how i ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ?
well , that's right . how about on a formal occasion ? what should i say to show my gratitude ?
and then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ?
dear fellows . as you know , mr . ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company .
that's our pleasure . mr . ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . and i hope mr . halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . remember me to him , please .
what a pity you are leaving so soon . i wish you could stay a few more days . sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?
cheers ! and we are honored to have such an honored guest today . mr . james , i hope we will meet somewhere in the near future .
is your application successful ?
that ’ s rather hard .
how will you get your pay ?
what sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ?
is there a union ?
so you must consider dearly before you go to work .
i will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . this is the assembly line . these drawings on the wall are process sheets . they describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step .
about 200 . they can assemble at least 3 , 000 computers every day .
yes , since i came to this company , i was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development .
well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . we believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . there fore , we always put quality as the first consideration .
hello , the international hotel . may i help you ?
what time would you like your table ?
would you like to sit in the hall or in the private room ?
wait for a moment , please . let me check whether the private room is available or not . no problem .
oh . take it easy . as i ’ ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . and now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period .
well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period .
okay . can you give me a reply tomorrow ?
well , betty . since you ’ ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . and now we need to sign the formal agreement .
of course . if you have any questions , just bring them out .
yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . do you have any other questions ?
yes , welcome to our company . i hope we can cooperate happily .
fred , have you made the plan for april 28th ?
you go !
what is your salary now ?
what's your expected salary ?
i can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . is this satisfactory ?
any question about the work ?
the general manager of your section .
we'll offer that on holidays .
yes , we have inspection abroad .
the smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . can you draw up a schedule for them ? if they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made .
they would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing .
madam , i made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . i think there are something needs to modify .
first , about the terms of payment . your draft contract says that payment is to be made by d \ a . this is not our practice . we prefer to have the payment made by l \ c through a negotiating bank in america .
the second thing i would like to point out , that is packaging . it's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . but i think the wooden cases are much safer .
as far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . thank you very much .
here is the final draft of our contract . i'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade .
do you have some points to bring up ?
yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . are all the terms here satisfactory ?
we've settled price , order , payment , now i am calling to ask about package . how can we pack the goods ?
do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ?
oh , i know . does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if i insist on using wooden cases ?
good morning . what can i do for you ?
this is our new brand . i can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards .
with pleasure . it's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on .
the hard drive has 260 g and the ram is 4 g .
do you work well under pressure ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
how soon can you begin working for us ?
may i see the manager of your office ?
thank you . i am fred , coming from future clothes company . i've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . i wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them .
we are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . i think you will be interested in some of our new products . we always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers .
as you know , we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications .
two months at most .
hi , bob , this is john lin .
i'm with hartford public relations . i'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
i'm afraid i've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week .
i will explain the problem briefly . we found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged .
can we get in touch with you by e mail ? is this convenient for you ?
thank you for your interest in our company .
what course did you like best ?
do you feel that you have received a good general training ?
what are you greatest strength ?
does your present employer know you are looking for another job ?
do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?
it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so i can not bear it anymore . it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .
definitely !
how do you spend your spare time ? are you interested in sports ?
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
sorry , i overslept . my clock didn't go off this morning .
that's right , even though i did set the alarm last night .
david , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ?
so , i wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . if you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
as we are a well established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
to be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , i think the amount will be 50 , 000 pieces a year .
you know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . so , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ?
if that's the case , we can talk about it first . what's your concept of a big amount ?
i'm afraid that's too much for us .
all right , we accept the challenge . what about the commission ? you know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal .
you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 20 % commission will not leave us much .
have you finished that report yet ?
how much time do you need ?
last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ?
john , you have done a good job . our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . they intend to sign contracts with our company . you really did a good job .
hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best .
why not ? you've done so well for the company . she should give you a prize .
but the sale number is close to the predicted amount .
i'm afraid it's a bad news for you . there are some problems in your supervised goods .
i overheard this information when i passed arden's office . we got some complaints from consumers yesterday . i am terribly sorry for that .
calm down ! it is useless to act like that . can we find some solutions ?
but we still have to find one . can we find arden to check whether this is true or not ?
excuse me , i want to know the price of your cpu .
it's rather too high . if you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously .
well , can you explain it to me ?
can you reduce more ?
in that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . please reconsider .
if you can give us a more reduction , we'd be able to give you an order on the spot .
your summer clothes for white collar and men's jackets .
that is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
do you quote cif or fob ?
what are your terms of payment ?
another question . could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
well , i got all the point . all the decision will be made since i get the approval from my supervisor .
i've come to hear about your offer .
i can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
i am afraid i can't agree with you there . i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
i agree that yours are of the top .
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
well , let's have your firm order .
your price is rather high . we cannot accept it . can you bring the price down a little ?
i can't agree with you . we have quotation from other sources too . their prices are lower than yours .
we have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . now i am calling to talk about the terms of payment . what are your terms of payment ?
i see . payment by lc is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept da or dp ?
what about the cost of delivery ?
how about the repair fee ?
great ! when can your technicians come to our factory ?
mrs . lin . please hold all of my calls for the next hour .
yes , i'll talk to her .
why are you quitting ?
tom . please do not disturb me for the next hour .
yes , and i don't want to be interrupted .
lucky number . find its location now .
here it is . well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from .
good morning , sir ! please know some about our latest products .
they are our products . please come in and have a look . this is the catalogue for our products .
of course , here you are .
would you sit down and write down your name and address here ?
bob from accounting is on the line . do you want to speak with him ?
marry wang's office , this is marry .
how can i help you ?
do you want to talk with john with tongue ?
when should i tell him to call back ?
all right .
marry lin's office , this is linda .
hi , mr . wang , what can i help you with ?
certainly , hold on .
dodge automobiles , may i help you ?
no , i'm the operator .
john li's office , this is jenny , may i help you ?
yes , but let me check if he's available .
beauties picture , how may i help you ?
he's out of his office .
dan more's office , how may i help you ?
may i tell him who's calling ?
just a minute please , mr . white .
lin's office supplies . how may i direct your call ?
sure , just a moment . . i'm sorry no one answer the phone .
certainly !
good morning everyone . thank you for attending the meeting today . i'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda . so let's get started with the first issue .
i would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have mr . brown , who is vice president of sales . next to him is ms . arts , director of marketing for the atlas company . in the back row is dr . barolo , who is visiting from italy . thank you all for coming .
tom , hi , this is mary with gold star mortgage .
we'd like you to come to work for us .
i see .
ok , folks , let's get to work . we need to come up with some ideas for the new essentials perfume campaign . this is a really big contract and we are under a lot of pressure here to impress the client .
hi , is this sue ?
sue , this is tom lin from allied trust and i'm calling to offer you a position with our firm .
it starts at $ 30 , 000 . s
you are seemingly upset . what's behind you ?
that's not as complicated as you suppose .
it is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . and we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field .
correct . and our country follows the priority of use principle .
what are you doing , janice ?
patent ? are you also learning something about patent ?
you are well informed . can you tell me something about the patent law in our country from the book you are reading ?
so coincidental . actually we can exchange some information on this problem .
is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ?
how long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your patent law ?
since china was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . one of these commonly used forms is co production . would you please do a bit explanation of it , mr . walker ?
i think the principle of co production is to expand export trade . it's a reciprocal business , isn't it ?
may i speak to marry ?
ok , i'll try her back then .
as you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , l series .
i know that . i need to discuss this with arden . and in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and internet should be adopted in this campaign .
well . we plan to contact www . on line advertising . com . cn and shanghai morning newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule .
what kind of media do you recommend ?
well . arden just mentioned the paper and the on sales . and i can talk about tv with him later , because tv promotion gets more and more popular among consumers .
you ’ ve been a sales manager for three years . how do you like the job ?
if i may ask , are you happy with your salary ?
is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ?
let's get down to business .
yes . i have . i'm interested in your underwear . if the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon .
what's your price ?
that's a bit more than i was prepared to pay .
i offer you 110 yuan .
all right . i go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . is that acceptable ?
well , i'll accept the price and place an order for 10 , 000 pieces .
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
what makes you angry ?
how was your interview ?
what did you say ?
did he want to know the reasons ?
that ’ s sex discrimination . when will you get the reply ?
wish you good luck !
mrs . phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods .
i informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month .
i am afraid we can not do that . would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ?
of course . well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months .
i'm afraid that's as far as we could go . we'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit .
what are your personal weaknesses ?
are you more of a leader or a follower ?
do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
are you available for travel ?
hi , tom ! this is marry with hans furniture store .
we considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience .
why have you stopped production ?
ok . make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . why is there oil all over the floor ?
i'd like to speak to robert .
well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and i'll arrive at 10 a . m . shall we say 11 o'clock ?
oh , yes . that's fine with me . maybe we can have lunch together .
all right . i want to bring everybody back on this subject . when can we start working on this ?
i tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and i'll come by at around 3:00
good morning , textile import & export company .
that's all right . maybe we can make another arrangement .
i'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . in fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon .
i'm terribly sorry , mr miller , but mr . zhang is really busy this week .
please let me check . tomorrow afternoon yes , he'll be free from 2:00 tomorrow afternoon . do you think it's convenient for you ?
hello . mr . zhang . it's mary .
i'm afraid we're really staffed this week , mr . li . i'd like to meet you , but i'm sorry i really can't .
not at all , sir . i'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , i'll have time at the beginning of next week .
how about monday morning at 9 a . m . ?
i see there are some workmen on the site . when is the building work due to start ?
how long will the sub contractors be on site ?
let me check . it's 3 . 80 m .
how's the building work going ?
what's the problem ? we really can't have any delays at this stage . we're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget .
i'm phoning about the factory visit next friday . what should i do when i arrive ?
we've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .
mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
have you always been on this site ?
why did you move ?
quality is very important to us . we work to very low tolerance levels . we need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers .
hi steve . what do you think of the new supplier ?
that's good service . do we have to pay extra for that ?
how do you choose which companies to work with ?
what do you do ?
i was surprised to see how few people you have on site . you provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .
do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
rose , is this you ?
this is susan . would you mind taking charge of decorating the office for our christmas party ?
you can get your supplies upstairs from mrs . horn .
mark , you really did a good job .
you must have spent much time on the project .
your project made much profit for the company . and the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
what do you know about our company ?
very good . if you enter this company , what department would you like to work in ?
ok . oh , how much do you make at your current job , if you don ’ t mind my asking ?
well , the starting salary for a clerk in our company is 2 , 500 yuan monthly and after three months he would get a raise if his work is satisfactory .
sure , we provide semi annual bonus , a small bonus at spring festival , four weeks paid vacation a year .
we can buy that for you .
this computer isn't working properly .
hello , this is lucy . may i speak to mr . smith ?
i'm afraid i can't come to work today , mr . smith .
i've got a fever and a very sore throat .

yes , i'll be managing the guys on the dock .
good morning , everyone . let me introduce myself to you .
well , thank you very much but i thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .

hello ! you're welcome to guangzhou fair .
glad to meet you , mr . smith . my name is wang and here is my name card . i'll be glad to do what i can for you .
glad to . the fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with china .
ours is a company special in exporting leather products . and what about yours ?
good morning , sir , can i help you ?
i'd be glad to , sir . but may i ask what line of business you are in ?
i see . would you be interested in seeing the audio visual products ? they are made by our company .
yes , of course . would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ?
i'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow .
we are interested in some precision machine tools . we have some inquires on hand .
can i have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ?
i think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies .
your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff .
ok , i'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list .
well , i am all ears . maybe they are helpful .
i understand what you mean , and i will not upset myself . face it .
you are going to work as my office secretary from next monday . right now i want to show you the rules of our company .
the working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . make sure never to be late or absent . every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company .
i heard nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . i also want to work there .
i know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy .
actually , i am afraid i will be stuck in the job forever , if i choose a bad one .
we're interested in your drawn works . what about the supply position ?
here's our inquiry list . you'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there .
that's fine . by the way , do you quote fob or cif ?
then would you please make your prices cif including five percent ?
we have made some adjustment on the prices . and this is renewed price list .
this is our rock bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .
then what ’ s your counter offer ?
we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter offer and our price is too great .
how about meeting each other half way in order to conclude the business ?
yes . we regret we cannot maintain our original price . since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
i don't think so . you must compare our price with that of other export houses . i'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
i ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
we've already cut down our price to cost level .
we spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . we won't sacrifice quality for quick profits .
great , i'm glad we'll be able to do business together . i'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning .
how can i be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ?
but a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard .
your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . can you tell me a little about that ?
what are you doing here ? how about your resume now ?
don't act like this . please have good thoughts in your mind . what's behind you ?
there is no need to do like this . we can surf the net and find some templates for resume .
you said it . we can also find some helpful advice from some experts .
how's everything , janice ?
which company ?
yep ! i got some , in which i am interested . but .
you get me !
can you help me ? the program is not responding and i don't know what to do .
no . it isn't .
but i can't move the cursor at all . my screen is frozen . what should i do ?
yes , but nothing's happened .
i've never done that before . will i lose all my files ?
i can't open this email attachment our paris office has sent me .
well , yes it's definitely the same program but i might have the wrong version . their system is newer than ours .
the system keeps crashing when i try to access the personnel database .
is that a no smoking sign ?
what does that sign mean ?
i ’ ve been having problems getting onto the internet .
could you just run through the evacuation procedure ?
should we use the stairs ?
what should i do if i notice a fire ?

welcome to our company , my name is jon dahl green . i'm in charge of the export department . let me give you my business card .
how was your flight ?
here's your schedule . after this meeting , we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . and you'll be having dinner with our director .
sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ?
i'm very glad to hear that .
the unit price is $ 12 . 50 .
i'm afraid we can't . $ 12 . 50 is our rock bottom price . if you purchase more than 10 , 000 units we can reduce it to $ 12 . 00 .

in foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .
exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .

the environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
but the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
good morning , and welcome to live tech . it is my honor to make this presentation for you . let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . you will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting edge technology inside . all of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use .

i'm here to sign the agreement .
can you speed it up and let us have it today ?
let me have a look . well , it contains basically all we have agreed upon .
i don't think so .
mr . wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment .
do you mean you prefer a deferred payment ?
when do you start the payment then ?
we can accept that but you have to pay the interest .

steven , what's your idea of price ?
i'm afraid that's impossible . you can't expect us to reduce it to that extent .
price can't be separated from quality . a comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior .

even with volume sales our costs for the exec user won't go down much .
we could take a cut on the price . but 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . we suggest a compromise 10 % .

thank you .
you are so kind , you helped me a lot .
have you find any job that you are interested in ?
there ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ?
that ’ s a good idea . you have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ?
by the way , i saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in .
it is a job at an advertisement company .
china is now a member of world trade organization . as a member of to , china will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other to members . is it fair to china , do you think ?
we can infer that the non discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of to agreement . this principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ?
today , we have invited a special guest , prof . yang . he will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . your international legal advice is important to our business well being . please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises .
in spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。
how can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ?
as you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in asia . what is the current legal framework in the countries ?
several years ago , the countries and china singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years .
what do you think of our price ?
yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
i don't think so . you must compare our price with that it other export houses . i'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
i'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
we've already cut down our price to cost level .
yes this is the best we can do .
here is the draft contract , mr . brown . let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . then i will make out an original of the contract . after that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .
the contract is to be written in chinese and english . both languages are equally effective .
that's a good idea .
agreed .
what do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ?
that certainly is quite an accomplishment .
what's your sales record been like there ?
if things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ?
how do you do , mr . johnson ? i'm thomas .
i'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper .
i have worked for ibm for three years .
i know the marketing from top to bottom and i can develop a new market for you .
yes , i understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company .
if possible , i'd like to be positioned in the international trade department .
it's about the best we can do , smith . we need to hammer something out today . if i go back empty handed , i may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job .
good . let's iron out the remaining details . when do you want to take delivery ?
let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st .
fine . but i'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . the 31 st is quite soon , i can't guarantee 1500 .
what's the price ? i hope you'll quote us favorably .
frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . we can't accept it .
it certainly is .
i look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their cif price , even lower than their home price .
that's the point . your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the cif price .
are you liu yan ?
have you brought your credentials ?
let me have a look .
your resume says you worked at dk company for two years . what were you responsible for ?
have you received any honorable title personally ?

yes , i do .
really ? we began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified .
professor wang can i ask a few questions ?
why does the government levy the tariff ?
anything else .
oh , i know . thank you . professor wang .
a hundred and fifty . no , wait , make that a hundred and sixty .
no , thank you . that will be all for now .
professor wang , what is non tariff barrier ?
can you give an example ?
why ?
oh , are there other means ?
this is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ?
miss liu , please come in .
copy this report for me .
you should use the a4 paper is all right .
it is unnecessary .
why isn't the project done yet ?
where do you see yourself three years from now ?
good answer , miss zhang good answer ! seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?
fine . what kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ?
are you introverted or extroverted ?
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
why do you say that ?
really ? are you still playing ?
i see . you must be tough .
what do you consider to be your weak points ?
what kind of people are you reluctant to work with ?
do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ?
are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ?
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
what basic principles do you apply to your life ?
miss liu , have we received the fax from ms company yet ?
excellent . i have been expecting it .
can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , miss thong ?
should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
mr . smith , while you're out , the sales department called and asked you to lunch next wednesday .
oh , yes , miss chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to july 11 and i've marked your diary accordingly .
what did you usually do as a head nurse ?
how to maintain a high standard of nursing ?
did you bring your certificate for nursing ?
how about your nursing education ?
can you manage english conversation ?
have you got any experience in advertising ?
would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?
have you had any experience with computer ?
that's fine . what about operating the fax and duplicator ?
what have you learned from jobs you have held ?
your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . what was your main work content ?
what had you gained mainly from this survey activity ?
i see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . i assume you haven't had any working experience . is that right ?
well , experience is not important in this job . we are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . by the way , do you like to work with figures ?
we are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . do you like meeting the public ?
we have very pleasant working conditions and i think we have a fine staff to work with . you would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . he would be responsible for training you . have you studied english conversation ?
yes , many of our customers are americans , so you would be speaking english with most of them . do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ?
how do you do ? nice to meet you , diane .
i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
that's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that's the best we can do . what do you think of that ?
alan , i believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . are you interested in some of our products ?
i'm very surprised to hear you say that . i think our price is very favorable . you can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers .
what's your proposal then ?
5 , 000 dozen is by no means a large order . in that case , the best i can do is to give you a 5 % reduction .
what's your counter offer then ?
15 % is impossible . that'll leave us almost no profit .
how about doing it this way ? you increase your quantity to 8 , 000 dozen and i'll give you a l0 % reduction .
well , to encourage future business , i'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . we can't go any further .
this is our rock bottom price and we can't make any further reduction .
then , what's your countr offer ?
we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter offer and our price is too great .
how about meeting each other half way in order to conclude the business ?
some of them are of the latest style . now i have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . we wish to establish business relationship with you .
concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank . or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies .
that sounds interesting ! i'll send a fax . as soon as i receive the definite answer , i'll give you a special answer .
so do i .
that is what i want to say .
hello , mr . jones . we need to have a meeting to discuss our deal .
thank you . i'm very glad to be here . as ms . tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new ebb . as you probably know , ebb stands for electronic book player . our company put the original ebb on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both china and the u . s .
certainly . first of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . so on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and .
oh , there are many uses and i'll explain them in detail a little later . first , i'd like to .
good morning ! my name is john white , import manager of the garden trading company of new york .
nice to meet you mr . li . we have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . as you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm .
yes , i had a look just now , i feel we can do a lot of business in this line .
our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years , we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the america , and we have good reputation in the commercial circle .
lily , i am terribly sorry about this . but we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .
sorry to say , but nothing can be done . the equipment broke down and can't be fixed till friday .
linda , have you prepared fully for tomorrow's meeting ?
great , we don't expect any big problems to happen .
welcome to our company mr white . my name is yan hua , the secretary of mr wang .
would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ?
glad you like it . by the way , is this your first time to china , mr . white ?
we also hope to expand our business with you .
i think you probably know china has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade .
right . seeing is believing .
actually , i was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract ?
i got it , but nevertheless . what i was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ?
what experience do you have with office machinery ?
where do you want to be in five years ?
very good . any questions ?

that can be a rough job , you know .
well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . what do you think ?
what do you expect to be doing five years from now ? what are your medium term career goals ?
good morning ! i am a rookie in our office .
nice to meet you ! my name is peter smith .
this is my first day at work !
thank you . it is very kind of you .
what are your career goals , miss li ?
great ! it sounds like you might be a good fit . as you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized . help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good . sort of makes up for the long hours .
well , that ’ s the problem . we never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . there would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work .
what companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ?
what section would you like to work in if you enter this company ?
what type of work will you expect to do at first ?
what are your plans for the future ?
how long does it take to get here from your home ?
how long do you think that we can depend on your working here ?
you are single now , but what will you do when you get married ?
what ideas do you have if we employ you ?
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
if you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ?
if you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ?
what do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ?
what are your expectations from working on this job ?
if you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ?
if we do not employ you , what are you going to do ?
hi , i'm calling about the ad in the paper .
for the job .
what company is this for ? i mean where's the opening ?
so you're a headhunter .
how about your interview ?
why ? you are so excellent .
what a shame ! you should have showed yourself to them !
i suggest you hunt for a job on the internet .
it's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
of course , if you log on some standard websites .
paul , a company called me for an interview .
how ?
is a white blouse ok ?
how about make up ?
i called about that ad we saw in the paper .
that's the one .
you were right . it was from a headhunter . she wouldn't tell me anything without a contract .
no ! not at all . but , i did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work .
i'm going there tomorrow .
may i help you ?
i'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?

i'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?

come in , please .
good morning , please make yourself comfortable .
your name and examination number , please .
pardon ?
yes , mr . du , when were you born ?
where do you live ?
your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high .
we are looking for a bilingual secretary . do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english ?
how are your typing and shorthand skills ?
how many kinds of secretaries work here ?
what sort of duties do you expect ?
i've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up .
what do you mean ?
you ’ re right , i don ’ t want to pay , but i don ’ t want to live without pay , either .
do you have anyone in mind ?
who ?
ya , they do . anyone else come to mind ?
well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . and is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ?
yes , our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses .
i've enjoyed the conversation with you . we'll call you within 5 working days .
office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .
how can we get in touch with you ?
about one week .
yes , . do you mind i have a look at your computer ?
well , it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the e mail capacity .
you would be using mainly english in this job . do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?
how many years have you been learning english ?
well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it .
what do you think of your personality ?
do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
when can you start the job ?
that's all right . when you come , ask for smith , ok ?
hello , this is lin tao . i am calling to inquire about my interview result last week .
did you hear something ?
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done .
hi , i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . a technician has just come and checked it . he will bring me a new one tomorrow . it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . can i use the one in your office ?
yes , i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
i can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
ok , no problem . we do it ourselves .
i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . may i ask why i was defeated ?
experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
maybe you can hire me on trial . if i'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . i ’ ve pushed the start button . it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . what ’ s going on ?
i didn ’ t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
hello , mr . hao . i am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . sorry .
i am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company .
i am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company .
you are welcome , please call me if you change your mind .
hello , is that miss lan ? this is nina with huawei corp .
i'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us .
i take care of the letters . i may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
yes , except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e mail box regularly .
sit down , please . mr . tang , do you bring any paper or certificate with you ?
are you still working in youth international travel agency ?
how many foreign languages can you speak ?
have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , i think it is not reasonable . what if there are some important calls ?
what are in this folder ?
are they filed alphabetically ?
can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?
we are redecorating and i'm going to add some things .
shall we meet at 1:15 this thursday ? we definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
how about your communication skills ?
what was your duty like in your previous job ?
can you name a few examples ?
thank you for calling abc company , may i help you ?
sorry , we have two smiths , robert smith and jim smith , which one would you like to speak to ?
what qualifications should a reporter have ?
can you work under pressure ? you know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper .
how do i make a good impression in the interview ?
anything else ?
what do you mean by this ? you can ’ t do the two things at the same time .
i see .
you ’ ve given me very valuable advice and i have more confidence in myself now . thank you very much .
hi , yang tang . come in ! pretty hot out there , isn't it ? did you have trouble finding us ? sit ! sit !
yang tang , just call me fred ! everyone does .
no problem . no problem at all . say , it says here in your resume you studied in california . great place , isn ’ t it ? i studied in california myself . i really enjoyed it . what did you like most about california ?
yeah , the people are quite relaxed . those were some great times i spent there . well , thanks for stopping by . are you from king dao , yang tang ?
may i help you ?
you are miss liu ?
please take a seat .
we have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview .
have you brought your credentials ?
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
are you more of a follower or a leader ?
how do you spend your free time ?
what kind of personality do you think you have ?
hello , lucy , i heard you did a good deal in interview .
what did you do in the interview ?
are all these helpful for the interview ?
anything else ?
may i come in ?
nice to meet you , mr . peter . i ’ m wang sian . i ’ ve come for an interview as requested .
thank you .
yes , after my graduation , i worked in a trade company in macao for one year .
the export business section .
yes , very much .
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
what do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ?
what did you do to put it into practice ?
why do you want to be a teacher ?
in what department do you wish to work if we hire you ?
how come it is slow as a snail today ?
yes , i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response for any click .
a : look at this survey conducted by a website . a quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . hi , francis , what about you ?
though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , i don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that .
but it is lucky for us . the company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . i have shopped too often online these days .
how are your chinese and english ?
what do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ?
hi , alan . i feel very nervous because i am going to have a job interview next monday . could you please give me some suggestions ?
yeah , that is very important .
i will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done .
brian , a company called me for an interview .
how ?
okay .
how expensive ?
i can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ?
how ?
is a white blouse okay ?
black ?
white pantyhose ?
jewelry ?
how about make up ?
do you have any sales experience ?
what kind of work are you doing now ?
where are you working ?
may i help you ?
i ’ m smith , the manager of human resources department . may i ask your name ?
would you tell me what education background you have ?
do you have any experience in this field ?
ok . do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english ?
ok . i will accept you for a three months period of probation . is this satisfactory ?
did you see the woman that just left my office ?
she's another applicant , and a leading contender , but i didn ’ t want to hire her . she ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . we ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . and green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust .
i realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want .
well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . they want people who look more like yourself .
well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . when they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . they don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work .
we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . but , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively .
how about your grades of study ?
besides your major , do you know some in other fields ?
have you ever been a student cadre ?
did it affect you much ?
in your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
hi , george . i'm going to have a job interview next week . could you give me some advice ?
yeah , that's very important .
i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .
but i love wearing t shirts and jeans .
it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes .
i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
it seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
what are you typing there ?
really ? did you find any information about a new job ?
great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
maybe i should try looking on the web for work .
but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . you might have no chance .
how did your previous employers treat you ?
what have you learned from the jobs you have had ?
when you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ?
hello , pratt . how was your interview yesterday ?
i am sorry to tell you that i have lost the opportunity .
yes , i know i am excellent , but i pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ ve told me .
when i entered the room , i forgot to close the door . later , i couldn ’ t help smoking , you know i am a heavy smoker . what ’ s more , i forgot to polish my shoes . there is some dirt on it .
yes , i know . and next time i must make good preparations .
are you here for the position advertised in china daily ?
what kind of information would you like ?
yes , it's still open .
miss wang , how do you do ? i ’ m allan james , the director of human recourse department of this company .
not at all . please sit down , then we can begin .
as you know , miss wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good english skills . we looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate .
come in , young man .
i am smith , the personnel director . please have a seat , son .
call me mr . smith .
are you married ?
how long have you been married ?
how many people are there in your family ?
who are the members of your family ?
where do you live ?
what's your permanent address ?
where is your birthplace ?
where is your domicile ?
give me your telephone number , please .
i think if i ’ m going to find a job , i ’ ll look over the job board .
right , so i picked up a copy of the sunday globe this morning .
not enough to worry about . why do i waste the money buying two papers ?
i guess you ’ re right . i'll get a herald as soon as i finish looking over the globe .
hello . may i help you ?
don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . will you please fill out this form ?
this is for registration . after you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . and we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you .
actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there .
my advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . if you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too .
i called about that ad we saw in the paper .
that ’ s the one .
you were right , it was from a headhunter . he wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract .
no ! not at all . but i did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out .
i ’ m going there tomorrow .
and i think i'll look in on a few other employment agencies while i ’ m downtown , to see what they have .
the boss announces the pay raise today , right ? how much do you think we'll get ?
it better be more than last year .
did you call me , sir ?
what am i expected to do ?
i see . it must be a challenging job , but i would like to do it . and what about now ?
good morning , sir . have a seat please .
sure , here is my business card . i'm james wilson . let me explain to you how things are . in recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . the price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent .
don't worry , sir . i think it's a seller's market right now . let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ?
what is the square footage of your property ? how many bedrooms and living rooms ?
what is the orientation and view ?
may i have your name and contact number , sir ?
thank you , mr . johnson . may i ask you one more question ? when will your property become available ?
thank you very much . i will introduce your property to our clients . when they want to see your property , i will give you a call .
i'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too tight .
why not ?
good morning mr smith . my name is susan and i am a reporter for the evening star .
i was hoping to talk to you today about your business .
how long have you been the owner of your computer shop ?
and how many staff do you employ ?
so this is a family business .
and how many computers do you sell each day ?
that about one hundred a month .
thank you b for your time .
good morning ann .
how about a cup of coffee ?
and can you tell me what meetings i have this week ?
okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm .
okay , what time is my meeting in london ?
who is ms von ?
good coming ! welcome to j p interior design .
yes , we do . do you have any specific needs ?
do you prefer some specific style ?
what kind of color tones do you like ?
i see . and what kind of feeling do you want to create for your kitchen ?
fine , we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it .
okay . would you please leave your address and phone number ?
taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the internet ?
do i have to send an e mail ?
but i still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
can any unit see my information ?
which websites offer this service ?
how do you want to advertise the opening ?
all right . i suggest posting the ad monday through friday .
and job seekers will certainly check the paper over on tuesday .
hi , steven . you have finished a wonderful project recently .
don't be proud . you'll gain a lot in the following job .
b , talking about salary is not smart . you are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills .
were you late for work this morning ?
what did you say to your boss ?
your boss was really nice .
you look upset . what ' s wrong ?
why don't you talk to your boss about it ? if you talk to him , he will surely understand .
would you mail a letter for me ? my hands are full .
that ’ s fine . we ’ re going to drop in and see jimmy tonight . don ’ t forget it .
good morning . miss lee . my name is alex jones . i'm the new assistant in the office .
yes , i'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job .
this is wonderful . thank you for doing all this for me , miss lee .
i hear that you've got a chance to go to europe for a half year training program . is it true ?
congratulations ! how can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ?
how nice ! but will you have to pay for the training ?
tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
is there anything else ? how about my salary ?
wow , thank you for telling me these . do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
can you skillfully operate the computer ?
what kind of software can you use ?
do you have any certificates on computer ?
any other certificates ?
do you have any other special skills ?
now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit .
have you received any other honors ?
do you have anything published ?
were you in a leadership position when you were a college student ?
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
as an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ?
and we should have good sitting posture .
where should i put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ?
i think that ’ s the reason why princess diana ’ s hair style became so popular .
i ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most westerners do .
i am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . but when i face a stranger outside , i get tongue tied and nothing comes out .
i will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer .
another problem is that i dare not look into their eyes whenever i meet strangers , especially foreigners .
is there anything else that i should pay attention to in an interview ?
i ’ ll remember to bring gum with me .
can you drive ?
are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ?
one more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently .
would you mind relocating ?
it ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ?
then you'll need to know it's a hard job . you'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends .
i have a feeling you will get this job .
you ’ d better double and triple check it . you don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot .
definitely . oh , do you have a reference letter ?
i ’ m included on your list of references , right ? my praise of you could really make a difference .
hello , nancy , nice to see you .
yes , i ’ m satisfied with this job .
pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self cultivation . good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .

we'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20 , 000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40 , 000 . a company car , and a company pension scheme . is that acceptable to you ?
excellent . well , thank you very much , mr . b , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way .
are you willing to work abroad ?
how about your family ?
my name is james owen . i ’ m manager of sales . how do you do ?
i apologize for this mess . they ’ ve got me handling so many projects , and it ’ s hard to keep things organized .
well . miss sun , as you know , we are looking for an executive secretary with good english skills and some business background . we looked over your resume and thought you might be a good candidate .
if we employ you , what starting salary would you expect ?
i think your background and experience are worth the compensation .

what course did you like best ?
english and computer skills are comparatively important to this post , especially in the starting period . wharfs your ability in these two fields ?

where are you studying and what's your major ?
why did you choose beijing university ?
what courses have you learned ?
what was your minor subject ?
what schools have you attended ?

nice to meet you ! my name is grace williams .
thank you . it's very kind of you .
mr . carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the shangri la hotel at 7:00 this evening . here's an invitation for you .
if you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , i'll be at the hotel to pick you up .

today is saturday , isn't it ?
what's the date today ?
i have a meeting this afternoon .
it will begin at three o'cock . what's the time now ?
i have to go now . i don't want to be late .
i heard you were promoted to general manager of ibm's china headquarters .
you did a good job for the company . you deserve it .
so . this is your first day in the new position . how do you feel ?
i believe you are cut out for this position . you're an outstanding individual .
good morning , mr wang .
it's just nine o'clock .
yes , you're on time . are you often late ?
you must leave home earlier today .
why are you so early today ?
hello , john , please invite all our clients to the conference next week .
get the clients ' contact info from my rolodex .
how about the holiday inn ?
well , the client is always right .
please print out the meeting agenda for me to look over .
and make sure to return my rolodex to my desk when you are done with it .
susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in china ?
retail is going upscale here ? china is certainly growing more quickly than i had imagined .
do you think the trend will continue ?
we'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting .
really ? i'll also try to speak slowly . how would you arrange the guests ' seats , jane ?
well , after my report , there will be an interval for rest and refreshments .
hello , mr . wang . i am glad to meet you here at the fair .
sure . thank you . it seems your business is prosperous . there are many customers here .
well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
we are willing to be your agent in thailand for hand held tools . what do you think ?
then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
4 % is too low , i think . you see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or tv , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . it all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
you mean to saya
we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
think it over . we hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
that was a very interesting presentation , ms . wang . my colleagues and i are very impressed with your proposal .
to show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us .
excellent . have you had french food before ?
so , now we have covered all the important points .
before we draft the contract , let's examine the details .
perfect . but what i ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。
yes ?
no problem . i ’ ll have the covering lc opened as soon as i wetback . in addition , would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment ?
please remember to use both english and chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid .
then i ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it .
do you get paid overtime ?
do you have any breaks ?
my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ?
yes , i do . i don't like it very much .
the price seems acceptable for me . but i want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ?
that's very good . shall we sign a contract now ?
excuse me . my name is richard davis of magic office supplies . i'm here to see mr . chen .
i think these patterns are quite good . can you give me a price indication of these ?
thank you very much . if your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract .
very good . how many goods do you have ?
we want to order 900 dozen .
i've just visited your showroom . you surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . i like them very much .
20 is very colorful and feels nice . i'd like to start with it . is it pure silk ?
thank you for saying that . but what's the unit price ?
the price seems acceptable . can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ?
we can offer you a 5 % discount .
well , what do you suggest then ? how about 8 % ?
what ? you want to drive me bankrupt ! you can't expect us to make such a large reduction .
how about lo % ? this price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large .
we're considering of ordering 200 computers , but i'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .
your price is higher than i expected . could you give us a little discount ?
but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
could you make it $ 4500 ?
let's close the deal at $ 4800 , ok ?
we are interested in your pure silk , but i'm wondering about the price . how much will you possibly offer us ?
that's much higher than i expected . can you come down a bit ?
supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ?
we're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . but , there's one problem .
i don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . if you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away .
strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ?
what's the advantage ? price , i suppose .
what deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ?
you don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ?
i'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to australia . can you do that ?
go ahead .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales .
no . but in the united states , the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 .
if that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it .
what's your last word as to the delivery date then ?
all right . i'll take your words at that .
hello ! is mr . green there ?
this is li with silk company . we met last sunday during the exhibition .
what about next week ? is it convenient for you ?
any time you say is ok .
hi ! may i help you ?
in fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions .
here is our brochure . it'll help you get acquainted with our products and company .
a month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .
getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . you cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month .
when will that be ?
is there anything that you are interested in ?
yes . it's a prototype of our new product . it has got more advantages than the second did .
it will be released next month .
we have developed new technology about it . and the new product will be a pleasure to be hold .
i think we have everything in the contract . shall we sign it ?
i believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation .
all right . i agree with you . but where do we hold arbitration ?
it sounds reasonable . the clause should be like this any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . if no settlement can be reached through consul nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . the arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties .
what shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ?
shall we leave it to the brokers ?
do they charge for that ?
is it the same in america ?
it's part of their service , isn't it ?
is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
i see . by the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
i see . thank you .
could you pick up mrs . david from ford company at the capital airport ?
i'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . he said he couldn ’ t come back to beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him .
what certificates of technical qualification have you got ?
have you worked in a computer company before ?
do you have any ideas on this work ?
my name is li jean .

what courses have you completed at college ?
have you learned any other foreign languages ?
do you know that is a hard job ?
is there anything you want to ask about ?
you are still a student ?
are you sure you can be a successful cashier ?
that's only for your theory foundation . i am afraid if you have ever handled large amounts of cash before ?
good . i think you'll make a good cashier .
hi , i am so glad to see you .
you know , i'm about to graduate and i have to look for a job as soon as possible . but i haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job .
i guess first i should prepare a resume , right ?
i got it . then i should mention my educating background and working experience , should i ?
i see . is that all there is to it ?
oh , good point . you mean here i should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss .
that's easy .
what do you think about our company ?
why do you think so ?
in what business are you most interested in this organization ?
have you had any experience with sales work ?
what exactly did you do at that company ?

do you have any other questions ?
salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company .
salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job .
mr . dick . does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?
but i find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . so i doubt its authority .
could you tell me whether or not i send out my resume with it ?
anything else ?

but those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided .
you should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview .
in a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all .

dm210 is equivalent to 400 rib .
are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ?
i have cut the price the minimum . you know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . we could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . this price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit .
i'm sorry , peter . i hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now .
can i help you , sir ?
yes . you should rent a brown suit and a black shirt .

i want to rent a formal suit here . do you have a purple dress here ?

i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
like this one ?
yeah , thank you for telling me .
how much do you want us to pay you ?
acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview .
we often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable .
don't forget to say thank you when you take a seat .
you can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way .
finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again .
i propose a toast to your pleasant tour in china .
what salary are you expecting ?
it can be anywhere between 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 a year depending on experience and qualifications .
do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account ?
no problem . we will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen
could i ask the company for the housing ?
how will you solve the problem ?
body language in the interview is closely related to the job hunter's image .
you should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him .
when you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer .
proper posture can show your confidence .
pay attention to keeping eye contact as well .
in a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview .
when the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief .
at this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview .
you should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently .
in this case , you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get .
just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave .
what are they ? i ’ ll be careful .
we have the orientation this afternoon .
the company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company id , batch , telephone , e mail set up and training .
yes , it is not easy .
would you mind if i ask the insurance policy of our company ?
i wonder whether i can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
from 11:30 to 1 o ’ clock .
what kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ?
what if an employee was injured due to work related job ?
do you give me a bonus ?
do you allow any commission ?
just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . you should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
you'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
i want to know whether you can handle the matters of registered permanent residence .
i have no other questions . thank you .
can we talk about the working overtime issue ? what ’ s on your mind ?
glad to hear that . generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours .
do i often have to work overtime ?
is there any extra pay for that ?
can you offer the five insurances for me ?
how are they get paid ?
jack , i don't know how to write my resume . could you tell me about that ?
what does the contact information include ?
anything else ?
i see . it is the position desired
i see . skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . but what about related experience ? i have little work experience .
i see . by the way , should i write the educational background starting from elementary school ?
sorry , i can't give you an immediate answer on the matter . it's pending now .
this is mary . i just want to let you know that we made an offer to you . the salary is 3 , 000 yuan a month , i e mailed the offer to you as well . you can let me know within a week if you accept the offer .
we hope you get on board with us , please let me know as soon as possible .
mary , besides the resume , i think we should also write an application letter .
i think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal .
we should say we are very interested in that job , and we hope to get that job .
for example , i have mastered business english very well , and i also know a little spanish .
you can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in english .
i am rejoiced to tell you that you are employed .
i'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position .
do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
what is your problem in working ?
i have a little trouble , and i don't know how to deal with it .
tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him , but i don't know how to write it .
really ? tell me without delay .
well , i see .
it's easy to write those .
tom got along well with classmates . he is really a good boy .
what should i write except these ?
what do you consider to be your weakness ?
anything else ?
so , monica , how do you like your new office ?
that ’ s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
good morning , this is mary .

what kind of job do you intend to do ?

jack , i think it's best that i actively ask for the results of interview .
i think so , too . what do you think about that i write a letter of inquiry to the company ?
good idea . it is convenient and fast .

i think that about one hundred words are enough .
how are you , mr . stone ? i m farley .

30 % of the people are attracted by the style . buyers always pay great attention to packing . in my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing .
almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . maybe we should lower our price a little .
good morning , mr . robinson . i am afraid there is a change in today's program . i just got word that your appointment with mr . smith , the general manager of western textile co . , ltd . , will have to be put off .
mr . smith called just now that he had to fly to shanghai on urgent business today .

yes , mr . mason . i just checked with our office manager , ms . terry . she said mr . smith briefed her on your project . she is just finishing up a meeting now . she should be with you shortly . would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
actually , you'll know our products better after the visit . i'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along .

when would you like me to send those plans over to your office , mr . montgomery ?
that shouldn't be a problem . what is the exact address , again ?
i don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . it's too soon .
i've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to dalian . a part of the goods were damaged in transit .
when can you get the finished product to me ?
great ! that'll be ahead of schedule ! good work .
well , i'm glad i had a chance to see these samples , but i'm really not in a position to make a decision right now .
yeah , why don't you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week .
couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? that would make things much easier for us .
i can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days .

you are so smart . your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding .
you ’ ve got a great personality .
i believe you will . i ’ m very pleased with your work . your promotion will contribute to the development of the company .

not too bad , thanks . and you ?
i'm terribly sorry , but i've already made arrangements for wednesday .

and where would you like to meet ?
i'm not very familiar with chinese cuisine . what can you recommend ?

thanks , i will appreciate it . how long have you been here ?
the time has come to say goodbye .
i feel that way , too . but all good things must come to an end , as they say .
i've had a delightful time and i really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights .
you'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ?
hello , i'd like to see mr . baker for some business .
would 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning be alright ?
who will meet you at the airport ?
sure .
well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss .
i also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . i spent half of the weekend on a train ! surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets !
i see . well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . it was really tiring for me .
thank you . i can't imagine getting much done today . i'm just too exhausted !
welcome , mr . sun .
i am running chinese arts and crafts .
here's the schedule we've prepared .
do you mind if we talk about your schedule tomorrow ?

so , emily , how was your day ?
it can't have been that bad . go on and tell me about it .
why ? what happened ?
that's not very fair . what did you do ?
does he treat everyone in your department like this ?
do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ?
is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ?
i have some good news for you . we've decided we'd like to send you to shanghai on a business trip this weekend .
i thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . everything will be paid for and i'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . all you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm .
oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . besides , you're in first class , so you'll be fine .
they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9
we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system .
well , what did you think about the last candidate ? do you think we should hire her ?
what made you think that she wasn't very confident ?
she was a bit nervous , i guess . what else ?
you're right . if she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ?
i agree . i guess i was paying more attention to her answers than her body language .
that's true . i guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then .
good afternoon , mr . stein . i wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ?
great ! our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the beijing hotel at 7:00 . here's an invitation card for you .
i'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 .
excuse me . but are you mrs . smith from america ?
yes . nice to meet you , mrs smith .
good morning , oriental electric limited .

i'm afraid there is a bit of a problem . in fact , he has booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon .
please let me check . tomorrow afternoon . yes , he'll be free from 3:00 tomorrow afternoon . do you think it's convenient for you ?
all right . let's change it . tomorrow afternoon at three . i am going to schedule it for that time and inform mr . liu about the change .
don ’ t say that . it owes to your efforts and team spirit .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
i have applied for a transfer .
yes . i think it's time to move on . i ’ ve already been here too long .
well , i want to be transferred to the shanghai office .
good morning , mr . zhang .
how are you ? how nice to see you again . how is everything going ?
not bad , thanks ! our company has sent me to pick you up here .
i realize that . we don't have anytime to waste . i can put you down for 9
may i speak to mr . huang , please ?
well , you see , i won't be able to keep my 9

cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . i am speaking from my experience .
and you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge .
if you have any problem in your work , let me know .
hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ?
what does it say ?
i can smoke outside of the office . but what else does it say ?
ok , ok , got it . by the way , what about the vacation policy ? anything changed ?
can we have 7 day holiday on national day ?
that's great !
are you kidding ? i always get up late . oh , my god . can't believe that . that is terrible .
how was elvin ?
another note ? but how ? i didn't see anyone !
uh oh . he's heating up . what are you going to do now ?
that's right . once the contract with stars . com is final , we'll deal with zina .
don't jump the gun . she's in the driver's seat right now . you have to be patient .
if we want to beat webtracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand .
you'd rather lose to webtracker than do things my way ?
dave , there's something i want to talk to you about .
i've been talking to webtracker . i'm thinking of jumping ship .
keep your voice down . we'll talk more later . right now i need to see vince .
i can't stand the stupid guy any longer . it's unbelievable .
he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
i've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me .
oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
oh , so bad . i'm afraid i'll change the image of myself .
but sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless .
that's right . i should speak to them in a polite way .
thanks very much and you're very eloquent .
i was really glad to hear about your promotion . congratulations !
sure , but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it !
you are always responsible and careful .
thank you . i'll try my best . by the way , when do you take over the new position ?
so what are you responsible for ?
so you must get higher pay than before .
1 , 000 yuan ? that's great ! so .
really ? can i order anything i want ?
hey , benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ?
what ? man , you don't know how to write a project report ? that's sounds a little bit ridiculous .
oh , sorry , i've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic .
let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events .
i'm sorry . there isn't . because different people have to write different kinds of reports .
thank you very much .
oh , my cv . yes , here it s . there are three copies .
no , i haven't . i'm awfully sorry . can i send them to you ?
i haven't been involved in international business , so i don't have any experiences , but i am diligent and i learn very fast .

ok . you are good . hope to see you next time . i'll call you if you get picked for next test .
how is your job search 1 going , janet ?
are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands !
i can see that . but i didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work .
i've been so tired recently . i've been trying , but i don't think i'm up to this job .
oh , yes , indeed . i've run out of steam . to be honest , i want to be in a different environment .
yes , i don't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ?
ok , i see . as far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ?
i'll call the bus charter later . and have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ?
that's possible . at that time , they can choose any activity they like .
let me think ! pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that .
one more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ?
would you like me to type it for you ?
not at all . i ’ ll be glad to do it .
shall i right out again first ?

i'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building .
don't play hard to get . the pay is good . you'd be working with elvin again .
hey , ken . i need to talk to you .
can we step into the conference room ? this is a more private conversation .
ok . i'm just going to lay it all out on the table , what do you think of vincent's management style ?
i don't want to put you on the spot . here's what i'm getting at , i don't think vincent is the man for the job .
as i see it , he lacks the proper vision . his style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere . he ' s treading water instead of swimming .
i've been with this firm for 26 years and i'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills .
yes and no . we can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting .
but how did you know i was working for webtracker ?
he couldn't have told you . only a few people at webtracker know about me .
i can't believe it . i can't believe i fell into your trap .
ok , let's find somebody then .
wait a second , vince . you know what ? why don't you let me handle it ?
yeah . let me see if he'll do it , and i'll get back to you .
come again ? what are you talking about ? aren't we on the same team now ?
what do you mean ? you didn't ? oh , no . no !
do you want to know what really motivates vince to be nice to me ?
it isn't gratitude . it's fear . vince is afraid i'll jump to a competitor .
i think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music .
i'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen .
he'll see it . it says , i like sweets . meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
hi , dave . you're early .
i had an idea .
i'm sorry . i know you feel betrayed .
my accounts go where i go . vince knows that .
right . the faint of heart should not apply .
hi , zina . lots of people are looking for you .
like elvin . he isn't too happy about what you promised stars . com .
you do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ?
is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ?
who has been here already this morning ?
they're small fry . tonight i'm going to la to negotiate with stars . com . that'll be big .
who else has been here ?
bull . i're done my research . i know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options .
exactly .
how ?
i'm really confused , zina . will you explain all this to me ?
yes . if we get it , we'll really be set for success .
ok , i'm with you so far .
hi , jeny . are still working ?
so , you are leaving , aren't you ?
how nice ! i can see you are busying packing . i'm sorry to interrupt you .
yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
excuse me for taking your time .
excuse me sir . may i come in ?
i'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so i
but it's true .
that's coincidence 。
i promise i will .
jack ! you've really done it this time .
i told you to get this consignment out last week . we can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? what am i going to do with you ?
well , i guess i could give you one more chance , but this is the last time . in themeantime , i hear that tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ?
i'd like to speak dr . johnson .
this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back , please ?
good morning !
would you hold on a second , please ? miss cooper's extension is engaged .
i'm sorry , sir . i can't interrupt her . i'm sure she won't be very long .
i really can't say how long she'll be .
yes , certainly .
yes , sir . i'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
oh , i'm sorry . however , if you could help me out , i'll double the pay for the hours worked .
i'll need them for the conference on monday afternoon . do you think it can be done by then ?
john , could you come to my office ? i need to talk to you .
no . come here right now .
what's the matter ?
well , some of those other guys are not the same kind i'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . i'll try to get along with them .
ok . i need to think about that for a while .
hello . green trading company . what can i do for you ?
didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ?
how about friday afternoon ?
oh , how do you do , mr . zhang ? this is mary speaking , i have a present for you from wu of beijing .

may i come in ?
i'm sorry to trouble you , but i'd like to ask when i will get a raise .
you said the same thing three months ago .
you mean that i won't get a raise until the recession ends ?
i got the message . i'm quiting .
i've been here for 3 years , and i haven't had a raise in all that time . if you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and i feel it isn't .
to start with , may i know why you are interested in working for our company ?
now you are with quandong company . what is your chief responsibility there ?
do you have any questions about the job ?
certainly . this is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas .
mr . black , i ' d like to take some time off . i ' ve been feeling exhausted these days .
yes . i was wondering if i could take another two weeks off .
the project i'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . i'd like to take my leave from next monday on .
thank you , mr . black . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . mr . smith will be in charge during my absence . he is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
what kind of job are you interested in ?
i really appreciate that i would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs .
have you had any experience as a guide ?
once in a while we have visitors from abroad and i would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing .
is it all right for me to come in now . mr . sutcliffe ?
do you mind if i sit down ?
i want to leave the department . do you think i could put in for a transfer ?
do you mind if i speak frankly ?
well , you see . i don't like the office . i don't like the staff . and i'm afraid you and i don't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
hi , my name is tom .
nice to meet you too . melinda .
really ? this is a nice office , but it's quite small .
it looks like you guys work hard .
hmm . tell me more details about our jobs .
mary , could you please come in for a short while ?
welcome to our department . i hope you'll like it here .
sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me .
what sort of experience do you have ?
where was your last job ?
why did you quit your last job ?
good morning . my name's pat green .
i read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant .
i think so . but before i apply , could you tell me more about the work ?
i used cassette recorders a lot when i studied english in high school .
how many hours would i work a day and what's the pay ?
ok , i'll take it .
good morning , i ’ m daniel . i ’ m applying for the positon of manager .
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux , lipton and walls . after making a customer survey , i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
i don ’ t think so . as the saying goes , a great oak needs deep roots . i ’ m really interested in this job .
what a busy week !
right . how are you going to spend your weekend ?
would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ?
you should try it . it ' s a great game . come on , let me help you . i'm a good player , and a good teacher , too . what do you say ?
that was a pretty good shot , mary .
of course , you can . all you need is a little help and a lot of practice .
well , maybe not a michael zhang , but better than the average . person would you like to play again wednesday ?
how about your study at college ?
why did you select your college ?
what do you like doing in your spare time ?
why did you apply for the position ?
what do you hope to become ?
good morning . are you mr . liu ?
how do you do ? please be seated , how is your trip here ?
hum , still a student ?
what subjects are you studying ?
have you had any working experience .
how are your english and computer skills ?
nice to meet you , ms . thou . we've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products .
yes . i had a look just now . i found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . i feel we
so , ms . thou , we're a newly established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over america .
i've run out of steam . to be honest , i want to be in a different environment .
yes . i don't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
yes , i want to get a better job .
i'm afraid not . i've promised my girlfriend . we're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay .
now this is our office block . we have all the administrative departments sales , accounting , personnel , market research and so on .
that's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored . we keep a stock of the fast moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . ( in the workshop ) this is one of our three workshops . this is the delivery bay here .
the steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . we buy them in from a steel works in wales . this is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . we doubled our output in this department as a result .
have you worked out the offers . mr . thou ?
are the prices on the list firm offers ?
i wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
how long does your offer remain valid ? i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
we have achieved great success last year . the most important is that we realize our strength lies in after sale service .
what we will do is to strengthen it .
this is our rock bottom price , mr . lee .
what i mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
what's your proposal ?
do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible !
since this is a sizeable order , i was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount .
only 3 % ? that's not much . if you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products .
here's our sample room .
yes . we are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . and the demand is getting greater and greater . by the way , which items are you interested in ?
yes . this way , please . our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . and different packaging has different weights . we can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require .
you are welcome to have a try . here it is . ours is of prime quality .
i was told that your company had been in the furniture industry for many years . what kinds of products do you generally handle ?
you know , we want to totally furnish our new office building . this is a list of what we need . could you give me a ballpark figure for everything on this list ?
if the furniture is pleasantly designed and high quality stuff , we intend to buy several thousand sets .
how was your appraisal with the boss ?
yes , i think he ’ s the most relaxed person in management .
that ’ s good . maybe you ’ ll get promoted .
we look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future .
we wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes .
we hope that our cooperation will continue .
we hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
we look forward to your settlement at an early date .
we are sorry to bring you so much trouble .
we are sorry for our fault .
i am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
we hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .

what's wrong with it ?

hi , vanessa . i ’ m don . i ’ m calling from seller ’ s market . are you still interested in a position as a cashier ?
my name is joan harris . i ’ m calling from st . johns hospital . are you still interested in a job as a service technician ?
i have good news for you . you ’ ve got an interview . can you come to the human resources office on thursday at 9 30 am ?
345 stony creek avenue .
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .
i met with the supervisor just this morning . i don't know , but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ?
no , it's not going to be george . i don't think it's andy either . he is involved with the boss's sister in law . and you know how whipped our boss is .
lisa ? no way . i've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors can't come out from nowhere .
no , that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear , it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i've got a family to support .
so you speak german , don't you ?
oh , i see . what other languages can you speak ?

many reasons . i've been here for too long . next year will be my five year anniversary . i want a change of setting . besides , our company is downsizing . i don't want to stay on just to be let go .
maybe . but that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . to be honest , i've got a better offer from another company .
senior director of market research . in addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . and it's an international company so i'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . i'm really looking forward to it .
indeed . but let's stay in touch . i'll let you know how things go .
good morning , mr . smith .
it is 9 o'clock now .
no problem . do you need the ohp ?
ok . do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ?
have you found another job yet , sally ?
what kind of job are you looking for ?
you haven't had any experience in either of those fields .
in order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you .
hello , this is abc corporation . may i help you ?
yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
why did the boss come down on joe like a ton of bricks .
he is then in a very difficult situation .
excuse me . do you mind if i ask some things about work for this company ?
i've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . is that true ?
if you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . is that right ?
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
your duty is to keep a check on those prisoners from now on .

how will you ship the order ?
can you tell me a little bit about yourself ?
please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
could you do something to advance your shipment ?
we expect the goods to be on the market before the end of december to catch up with the spring festival sales .
what's combined transportation ?
why is it necessary ?
we'd better have a brief talk about the loading port .
what's your unloading port , please ?
when do you plan to deliver the goods ?
please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment .
may i know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ?

i'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .
may i know the definite date of delivery ?
what do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?
that ’ s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we ’ ll need someone to hire staff .
yes . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd .
the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any contracts yet ?

has and advertising campaign been prepared ?

i think he might . you'd better go to his office .
a :: you must be wily . it's nice to meet you .
a :: tim , please . please be seated .
a :: so , wily , you have been with ibm for two years , ready for change ?
ok , so now the last point on our agenda . jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement .
let ’ s see . these numbers are off the charts ! what's going on here !
ok , thank you . i ’ ll look into it .
thank you , that will be all . i ’ ll take care of it .
how do you think the report i wrote ?
i jumped the gun .
how can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?
i guess this is a good excuse to surf the net on someone else's dime .
and how do you like working for ibm ?
what ’ s strength do you bring to the job ?
you look very professional in the suit .
could you give me an expense report ? i would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season .
that is very kind of you . i ’ m just running out of glue .
i met a girl in elevator this morning . she works in a company upstairs . she said she envied the casual way we dress for work . she complained about the dress rule in her company . it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday .
you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?
how do i submit an expense report ?
let ’ s call it a day .
it ’ s hard to commute a long way .
are you familiar with the office management ?
are you still interested in it ?
did you sign up for the picnic party ?
this time you can bring your daughter with you .
we need to know whether you have the special training .
how about your experience ?
we need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances .
so you're quite confident in your experience and skill
may i have your resume , please ?
do you like a job in a library , working with books ?
one thing i love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for .
he just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review .
actually not ! our company pays for performance .
i hope i could get promoted some day . tell me about your experience , ok ?
how do you think if i volunteer for some work ?
francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . in view of your achievement , i trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .
this title does not only give you a raising pay check , but also increase responsibilities . congratulations , and hope the best for you .
my computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . can you tell me how to make it run faster ?
how ?
you have been doing a great job this year and i am very satisfied with your work .
could you please cover for me two hours this morning ?
i have to see the dentist . we have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . so if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . if there is something urgent , tell them i will be back in two hours .
hi , lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ?
sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . people may think you are telling them how to do their work . if they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work .
you look really wiped out ?
not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning .
could i ask you for a favor ? my laser printer is out of ink and i need to print out something urgent . if you don ’ t mind , i would like to send you these files . could you then print these for me ?
thanks , vivian .
hi , still in the office ? it ’ s already 7 .
sounds like our boss . typically him always late with important information . anything i can help ?
ok , shall i make a coffee first ?
hi , francis , morning ! how are you doing today ?
indeed , i agree that is not a good start . how about the meeting ? you missed anything important ?
was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ?
really ? it took me really a while to find the color . i am happy you like it .
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . every time i go through my book of business cards , i will notice it . it is an eye catching one .
yes , it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
congratulations ! i heard that you are going to take a two week training course in the headquarter .
sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us .
well , good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training .
what ’ s the problem ? things are getting out of hand . you keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .
what is your most preferred training method ?
well , that is also very efficient , right ?
have you heard that we will have reorganization ?
yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department .
james is going to be packed off there .
the boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , i feel really down .
yes , everything . i feel overwhelmed by the daily work . sometimes , i just can ’ t focus on what i am doing . what is worse , though i make plans for a whole week , i always have to make changes later on because other things come up . i can ’ t manage my time well . i can ’ t handle work well . i am afraid i was screw up more things .
exactly , i overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , i guess . they were only three of us in the elevator , i felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them .
some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . people spend so much time at work . it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
beneficial ? i don ’ t think so . if two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . if they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . by any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
how would you describe your relationship with our boss ?
i am thinking about resigning from my current job .
yes , i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday .
yes , i will move on to xyz company .
what is the most enjoyable part about your job ?
what do you find annoying ?
hello , this is francis from xyz company . i would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . do you have time to meet ?
ok .
it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen pm . do you have a projector in your room ? i would like to show you some related charts
can i ask for leave this afternoon ?
i had a headache this morning . i didn ’ t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn ’ t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light sensitive . maybe it is the migrated .
i would like to ask for one day off next week . do you think the manager will agree ? i know it is the busy time for our company , but i do have some important things to handle .
actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i've got to be there , right ?
you must be very busy these days . i heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . it can be the most important meeting for our company this year .
do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? you remember ? i like that one .
what sort of job would you like to take ?
we need an operator now .
you must like negotiating a lot . people are saying , you are a super negotiator .
i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice .
sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down .
here is the document you asked for this morning .
you ’ re welcome . you know , these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it , the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
hi , monica , congratulations ! your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . and it was so persuasive and i bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . you really made a big contribution to our company .
you must have been prepared for a long time . some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ?
now , the effort pays off . you have accomplished something .
right , we have located a business partner in seoul . the first contact proves to be successful . the general manager of south korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . i think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon .
which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ?
then how about a salesman ?
i really like what you have . but the price for this product is much higher than we expected . i am absolutely not a buyer at that price .
i understand that . if you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now .
err , well , i can ’ t decide right now . do you mind if i have a small internal discussion on this first ? i will tell you our decision this afternoon .
is the view going to be ok ?
i ’ ll do my best .
i ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me .
i wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help .
are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? i'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .
then i'll see you in the afternoon .
i think you should look over these figures again . there are some calculations that are a bit off .
apology is accepted . try to do better next time .
we did a survey on your job performance .
not so good . lots of complains .
i'm really in a flap about the interview .
i'm in such a need of the job that i can't afford any mistakes .
hi , are you busy ?
okay , i'm putting together a report on the allied marketing co . failure , and i seem to have run into a stone wall . can you help me out ?
name it .
all right , i can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem .
give me the study . i'll start as soon as i get back to my office .
ha , ha , ha ! that's fair . how did i do ?
good , well , here's what i need from you . are you ready ?
well , i know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . i'm your client , not your company . as your client , i expect you to be square with me at all times . can you do that ?
both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position
right . the choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ?
hi , bill . it ' s marsha black at mppd ltd . how are you ?
not too bad at all . do you have a minute ?
we're ready to place our christmas order and we need a formal bid .
right , this is not a drill . this is for all the marbles .
asap , in writing of course .
the usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil .

the accounts department , i think .
look ! they're going to do the first drawing ! it's for a dvd player !
they're picking a name . it's . darryl from marketing ! rats !
our supervisor lester does . actually , lester is kind of like the kitchen god .
he just stays in the kitchen and watches you . before the chinese new year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . just like lester does !
actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did .
i think so ! just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . that will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you !
see how many people are here !
other than the employees , our boss jack invited some friends of the company .
of course not ! we have to sit at our assigned seats . i think our table is over there in the back .
look who you get to sit next to tim from purchasing !
don't worry . i'm also sitting next to you .
i can't wait until we get our year end bonus !
good afternoon . i'd like to speak with tom smith .
do you know when he will be back ?
is there some way i can get into contact with him ?
thanks . and could i have his e mail , just in case i can't get him by phone ?
thank you so much . does he read his e mails daily ?
great . thanks again . you've been very helpful .
our red underwear didn't do any good at all !
so , what did you win ?
a bar of soap !
this'd better be good . i'm about to fire you all and find another company .
mmm , smells good . sure better than my instant . but please don't tell me this is another coffee themed pitch . i thought i told you .
melanie , can you help me with something ? we need to finalize the account with the mexican embassy and , i need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in english .
okay , so . to whom it may concern , i am writing .
great , okay . dear miss cooper , i'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of voila magazine .
the final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty five thousand six hundred rib . we want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . thanks for .
oops , okay . you are right . then i can just end with all the best , tracy .
mr . drake , i'm pleased to do business with your company .
your company is very well respected . about how long have you been in business ?
and this is your company's head office ?
that's wonderful . isn't your company part of are corporation ?
that's not bad . how long have you been in pr ?
these three hours chatting with you have been very . interesting . could you please tell us why we're here ?
did you get bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the dalai lama ?
i figured i might as well send one or two of them out . maybe my luck will get better .
i've just got bean's new brand image . let's make a t shirt line with these pics .
exactly ! with the war in iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world .
could you tell me a little about the organization ? for example , how big is your workforce here ?
well i am used to that , mr . parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .
and when do you need to fill the vacancy , mr . parsons ?
well rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ?
okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . if any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . of course you can also call miss childs too .
well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . miss childs will call you to discuss more on monday or tuesday . how does that sound ?
the pleasure ’ s all mine , rebecca .
okay , well i ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
well feel free to ask me anything , and i ’ ll try to fill in the details .
well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . but we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
okay rebecca , well i think you ’ ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses .
definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?
so would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ?
well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ?
hi isabel ! you wanted to see me ?
is everything okay ? you seem a bit preoccupied .
okay .
what ? why ? i mean . just like that ? i ’ m fired ?
what ! i resent that !
and so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . thank you very much for your time .
aw , come on ; it was nothing . i'm just doing my job .
yeah , well , that was some good advice . you made some really good points .
good afternoon . may i help you ?
certainly , may i take your name ? i ’ ll let her know you ’ ve arrived .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
so , lauren , i just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , jason huntley .
basically , i ’ ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , i don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company .
yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times . take last tuesday for instance , he was forty five minutes late for our morning meeting !
but that ’ s not the only thing . you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , i ’ m constantly catching him on msn and facebook when he should be talking to clients .
mr . mckenna , do you have a second ? i need to talk to you about something .
well , i was just wondering . . . you see , i know i ’ ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . .
well , sir , i was just hoping that i might be able to take some unpaid leave this year .
i was thinking of taking off from september first until the thirtieth . would you be okay with that ?
so , casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ?
you ’ ve had over a month to get this finalized ! why are things delayed ?
hello , fairbrook consulting , how may i help you ?
certainly , what day were you thinking of ?
um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on thursday , how does next monday work for you ?
oh great ! this stupid computer froze again ! that's the third time today ! hey samuel , can you come take a look at my pc ? it's acting again . it must have a virus or something .
but i'm quite careful when i'm browsing theinternet , i have no idea how i could have picked up a virus .
ok . anything else ?
i've run out of steam . to be honest , i want to be in a different environment .
yes , i want to get a better job .
i'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties i have in getting along with my colleagues .
is it all right for me to come in now . mr . sutcliffe ?
do you mind if i sit down ?
i want to leave the department . do you think i could put in for a transfer ?
do you mind if i speak frankly ?
well , you see . i don't like the office . i don't like the staff and i'm afraid you and i don't get on . so may i put in for a transfer ?
john , could you come to my office ? i need to talk to you .
what's the matter ?
why ? i work very hard .
well , some of those other guys are not the same kind i'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . i'll try to get along with them .
it's unfair .
ok . i need to think about that for a while .
how do you like your job here , linda ?
i'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . most of the work is boring .
do you have any complaints ?
yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well .
i can't stand the stupid guy any longer . it ' s unbelievable !
i have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
i think that's a bad idea . i'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
if we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation .
our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well equipped for us to work efficiently . to improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space .
may i come in ?
i'm sorry to trouble you , but i'd like to ask when i will get a raise .
you mean that i won't get a raise until the recession ends ?
i got the message . i'm quiting .
i've been here for 3 years , and i haven't had a raise in all that time . if you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and i feel it isn't .
mr . black , i ' d like to take some time off . i ' ve been feeling exhausted these days .
yes . i was wondering if i could take another two weeks off .
the project i'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . i'd like to take my leave from next monday on .
thank you , mr . black . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . mr . smith will be in charge during my absence . he is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
i had the same feeling when i first came to work here . but after a period of time , i feel better , i am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .
how do you do ?
my name is wang liang , i ’ m from beijing . where do you come from ?
just over 4 years now . since this is your first day here , i'm sure you don't really know too much yet . let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
hi , my name is tom .
hmm . tell me more details about our jobs .
do you have a moment ?
i'm having some trouble . i don't know how to use this printer . i've never seen this kind of office printer before . is it a new brand ?
silly me !
oh , it's out of paper . do you have any more ?
which one is this ?
good morning , i ’ m daniel . i ’ m applying for the positon of manager .
i got to know your company through such famous brands as lux , lipton and walls . after making a customer survey , i was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of chinese .
i don ’ t think so . as the saying goes , “ a great oak needs deep roots . ” i ’ m really interested in this job .
welcome to our company .
an impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company .
now you are with quandong company . what is your chief responsibility there ?

i came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson .

because i admire your company . yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city .
yes , five years ago . i began to work in a fashion company in shanghai . two years ago , i came to beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman .
what kind of job are you interested in ?
i really appreciate that i would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs .
once in a while we have visitors from abroad and i would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing .

do you have any other computer qualifications ?

okay , rebecca . now you ’ ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? how would you describe your key strengths ?
yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ?
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
okay , now i ’ d like to find out more about your last job . i see you spent almost four years at the london weekly , is that right ?
so , what changed ?
wow , a real step up !
i see , so why did you decide to leave finally ?
now , if i look here i see that you completed a ba in english ?
yes , i ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
well , it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
what did that involve ?
i ’ m sure . okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ?
may i help you ?
i'm mary kelly . may i ask your name ?
i'm glad to meet you , mr . zhuang . sit down , please .
what are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ?
would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ?
your typing and stenography are pretty good . would you be interested in applying for the job ?
right rebecca . now i see that after graduating from university your first job was .
certainly . and after your internship ?
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ?
the london weekly right ?
now , miss childs passed on your resume to me and i ’ ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i ’ m quite impressed .
well yes , i do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
ah i see , so you were actually educated in europe ?
why do you want to be a stewardess ?
could you handle flying for 24 hours straight ?

great ! it ’ s a deal ! thank you , sir !
hello , this is abc corporation . may i help you ?
yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?

what are the requirements to apply for the position ?
do you think my educational background suits this position ?
does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ?
we ’ ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . we don ’ t want to make any mistakes .
that ’ s right . we ’ ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done .
i ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it .
that ’ s true . right . i ’ m going back to the meeting . it ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon .
good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long .
i ’ ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .

if you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . is that right ?
working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . is that true ?
how could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ?
we could contact alumni who work for large , well know companies . they might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets .
we should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . when people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information .
that ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . the lunch break is flexible . you can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
of course . the main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . we even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early .
you should attend a department meeting every monday morning . there are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week .
you are entitled to a company car . have you seen it yet ?
ok . this is your cubicle . at first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . later , you ’ ll be working more independently .
could you tell me your education background ?
where did you go to university ?
what degree did you get ?
what was your major ?
what was you g . p . a ?
do you plan to pursue further education ?
when do you think you will do that ?
i ’ m interested in teaching at your school .
yes .
i have a tefl certificate .
i have three years of teaching esl and four years of teaching per school children .
i got my tefl certificate three years ago .
well , i ’ ve heard many good things about it . i also like teaching young children .
i sure can .
what did you do at the office today ?
what kind of things did you need to check ?
i see . did anything else happen ?
it must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client .
i hate dealing with complaints . was it a legitimate complaint ?
you certainly had a busy day .
what kind of work do you want to do when you finish university ?
that ’ s a job that pays well . if you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . have you applied to any banks yet ? our course will end soon .
well done ! i haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet .
i ’ d like to work in marketing . i think i could have a good career in that field .
we ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ?
see julie , the receptionist . she knows where all that stuff is kept . you might like a calendar for you desk . she can give you one of those too .
the photocopier is near my office . come on , i ’ ll show you where it is .
yes , i do . everyone ’ s really friendly . sometimes , i wish i worked outdoors more , especially during the summer .
sandy , can you help me contact these people ?
they are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .
then , you should e mail them with the information .
they should have then listed on their resumes .
then send them a sms on their cell phone .
yes . i called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .
i left a voice message on one just for the first person on the list .
i told her that she should call me back at my office number .
yes , that sounds like a good idea . she might not get the other message in time .
sure . you can use this one . the pin number is written on the back of the card .
great work . i ’ m off for the weekend ! see you on monday .
john , i ’ d like you to meet charles brown , our new manager at the airport .
he is short , well built , and he ’ s got light blond hair .
he is in his late thirties .
hi , deny . are still working ?
so , you are leaving , aren't you ?
how nice ! i can see you are busying packing . i'm sorry to interrupt you .
yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ?
excuse me for taking your time .
i'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so i
but it's true .
that's coincident 。
i promise i will .
yes , it is not easy .
mr . bryant ? hi , i'm mike from florence incorporated . i'll glad you made it okay . how was your flight ?
that is a long flight . you had a layover too , is that right ? you must be tired .
good ! here , let me help you with your bag . is it your first time to seattle ? i'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it .
i've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . then , i'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . i've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . afterwards , i've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting . how does that schedule sound to you ?
hello , mr . benson , welcome to beijing ! is this your first time to visit china ?
yes , beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the olympics . what would you like to see changing be made for olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ?
i can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , i also recommend you to visit tian'an men square and city while you add it !
don't worry , i would be able to go along with you , over the next few days , if you have any questions or problems , i will be right here to help you out , i can be a translator and tour guide .
what ? the meeting was proponed ? no one told me anything about it .
what memo ? there haven't been any memos this whole week . i check my unbox every day , and i haven't seen anything .
you know how things get piled up on my desk when i am busy — i know that sometimes i do misplace things , but i always read all the memos that go around . they go directly to my in box . are you sure it was sent to the whole office ?
i'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . anyway , i am sure the memo never got to my in box . i'll have to talk to our secretary about it .
ms . dawson , i need you to take a dictation for me .
this should go out as an intra office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon . are you ready ?
attention all staff . effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos . the use of instant message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited .
it should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications .
they will just have to change their communication methods . i don't want any one using instant messaging in this office . it wastes too much time ! now , please continue with the memo . where were we ?
yes . any employee who persists in using instant messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation . at second offense , the employee will face termination . any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads .
office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .
yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .
here is the document you asked for this morning .
you ’ re welcome . you know , these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it , the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later .
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
oh , i'm sorry . mr . nelson is away at the moment . i'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . would you like to leave a message ?
certainly . mr . nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . he stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . his schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging .
of course , can you leave your name and number ? i'm sure mr . nelson will return your call as soon as he is able .
can you tell me what it's about ? i can make a note of it , so mr . nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call .
our productivity has been down for more than six months now . i'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . i think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees .
do you have his card ? what's in his portfolio ? which firm has he worked for in the past ?
hello , this is francis from xyz company . i would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . do you have time to meet ?
ok .

no , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me .
i see . what about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ?
i will call them this afternoon , thanks .
abc company , my name is lucy . how can i help you ?
thank you for your interest . the position is still available . have you already sent your cv to us ?
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you , i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
hello , i am richard from the brooks head hunter company . can i have a private talk with you ?

good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . today we have a great line up of speakers to talk to you . first on our program is a well renown expert in the field of international economic development , harvard's own dr . james smith . dr . smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at harvard since 1995 . and now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome mr . james smith .
could i ask you for a favor ? my laser printer is out of ink and i need to print out something urgent . if you don ’ t mind , i would like to send you these files . could you then print these for me ?
thanks , vivian .
could you please cover for me two hours this morning ?
hi , monica , i am afraid i can ’ t make it to the office to punch out .
i am still in xyz company , this meeting took longer than i expected . say to it that the office manager knows i won ’ t be in to punch my card .
i would like to ask for one day off next week . do you think the manager will agree ? i know it is the busy time for our company , but i do have some important things to handle .
actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ’ ve got to be there , right ?
can i ask for leave this afternoon ?
i had a headache this morning . i didn ’ t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn ’ t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light sensitive . maybe it is the migrated .
well . i want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here .
my computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . can you tell me how to make it run faster ?
how ?
francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . in view of your achievement , i trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .
this title does not only give you a raising pay check , but also increase responsibilities . congratulations , and hope the best for you .
hi , monica , how is everything going ?
that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
congratulations , francis . your hard working finally pays off . i am so happy for your promotion .
i hope i could get promoted some day . tell me about your experience , ok ?
how do you think if i volunteer for some work ?
marketing manager ’ s office . can i help you ?
sorry , he is out .
sorry , i am not sure . can i take a message ?
that ’ s fine . please call again later .
when can i have your firm c . i . f . prices , that is to say , the final offer , mr . london ?
yes . i ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 .
i don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . if your prices are agreeable and if i can get the commission i want , i can place the order right away .
i ’ m glad to hear that . as i ’ ve just said , i hope to conclude some substantial business with you .
i ’ m buying for chain department stores in canada . they are also interested in egyptian carpets . could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ?
if you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory .
let us know when you are free . we ’ ll arrange the tour for you .
we did a survey on your job performance .
not so good . lots of complains .
i ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along .
that is our office block . we have all the administrative depart ments there . down there is the research and development section .
about 3 4 % of the gross sales .
that ’ s the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock .
how do you think the report i wrote ?
i jumped the gun .
i ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . i hope to conclude some substantial business with you .
i ’ m interested in your hardware . i ’ ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . i think some of the items will find a ready market in canada . here is a list of my requirements , for which i ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , c . i . f . vancouver .
i ’ ll do that . meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ?
what about the commission ? from european suppliers i usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . it ’ s the general practice .
you see , but i do business on a commission basis . a commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . even two or three percent would help .
how do i submit an expense report ?
you mean i have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
good morning , miss monica . nice to meet you again !
the basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .
40 hours a week , monday to friday , 9 am to 5 pm with one hour lunch break every day
we do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like spring festival and the mid autumn day .
hello , mr . thomas . could you spare a minute ?
i need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him .
could you give me an expense report ? i would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season .
that is very kind of you . i ’ m just running out of glue .
with tomorrow being labor day and all , i think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . what do you say ?
i call this meeting to order . thank you all in attendance today , i know it's a busy day for you all . we have a lot of material to cover today . did everyone get an agenda ?
we should be able to finish everything up before then . let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . the first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting .
motion carried . now , next on our agenda is our budget review . margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ?
what kind of action is required ?
could i ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ?
how long is my paid vacation every year ?
how often is the bonus ?
do i have training opportunities ?
ok , thank you for your time and patience .
give these sales figures a look . it's pretty depressing . we're way in the red this year . we can't afford to keep going like this for much longer .
deman is dropping . the problem is our competition . they are monopolizing the market !
it's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . if we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt .
look at this numbers and see for yourself . read'sm and weep .
what's our target audience for this campaign ?
right , that makes sense . what's the average age ?
what kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? i don't know how effective sponsorship really is .
other than the marathon , what else is on the list ?
sports , medicine , education . seems kind of random , don't you think ?
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
fine . we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
what are our areas for growth ? what sectors do you see the most potential in ? if we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board .
which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ?
why is the price so high ?
model of computers aren't compatible ?
maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top quality product .
didn ’ t you punch in this morning , monica ?
that ’ s ok . i should have told you earlier . this is a company rule .
according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
from eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
good morning , i am monica . are you mr . white , the manager of finance department ? i am the newcomer and also working in the finance department .
thank you . i am very happy to have my own office now . i ’ ve never had one before . it is very nice .
really ? what could that be ?
good morning . i ’ m liu yi , from china xyz company . we have an appointment with mr . thomas .
thank you .
should each of us write separately ?
may i ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ?
thank you for telling me that .
what are they ? i ’ ll be careful .
i got it .
i am liu yi , from china xyz company . i ’ d like to see mr . thomas , please .
no , i am afraid not . i just arrive in town today .
would you please ask when he will be free ?
may i speak to mr . smith ?
is mr . thomas there , please ?
i said , is mr . thomas there ?
mr . thomas is making a long distance call . please wait for a few minutes .
coffee would be fine .
i like it black .
hello .
not really , i ’ m in a meeting . can i call you back in . say . 15 minutes ?
may i speak to mr . thomas ?
thank you for calling abc company , may i help you ?
sorry , we have two smiths , robert smith and james smith , which one would you like to speak to ?
we were decorating and i ’ m going to ask some things .
shall we need at one fifteen this thursday ?
we were decorating and i ’ m going to ask some things .
shall we need at one fifteen this thursday ?
good afternoon . i suppose you are ms . monica . my name is mr . thomas , the general manager of abc company . here is my business card .
ok , i understand . but why you choose us to work for ?
what ’ s your long term goal ?
i take care of the letters . i may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
yes , and i check all the e mails for mr . thomas .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
i've got some great news for you !
yes , i'll be promoted to department manager .
right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . i'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . i'll give you a brief summary . there are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy . for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . mark , did you have anything to add ?
it is enough for today . do you have any last question ? if not , thank you for taking your time to come to our interview .
we will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not .
what are in this folder ?
are they filed alphabetically ?
can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?
okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . let's review them all together .
that is our one major success . if you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase .
hi , i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . a technician has just come and checked it . he will bring me a new one tomorrow . it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . can i use the one in your office ?
yes , i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
i can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month .
ok , no problem . we do it ourselves .
yes , very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed , so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
would you please mail these letters , lucy ?
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .
it ’ s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
office address , please . he might be at work when they arrive .
i didn ’ t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out .
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules .
what are they ?
and what is the most important point ?
hello , this is francis .
today , i am busy all day long .
that ’ s not good for me at all . it ’ ll have to be another time .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
lucy , i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . would you like to help me with the ladder ?
i think i can handle it by myself .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . yeah , thank you for telling me .
we have the orientation this afternoon .
yes , it is not easy .
hello , this is lucy from abc company . is this monica ?
i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time .
oh , you can take the subway , get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes in total .
ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . you can do it in the next door .
everybody attention . i would like to make sure you all know the process . the interview consists of three parts . one , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . two , we will take a 30 minute ’ s break . after the break , we all come back to this office and i will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . in which , you have a small interview with your future manager .
what ’ s up ?
do you mind i have a look at your computer ?
well , it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the e mail capacity .
the demographic reports are in . from the looks of it , we're going to have to re evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues .
according to the report , our boston crowd is quite different make up from our chicago folks . our boston consumers are mostly from mid level to upper class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar . you know the kind . chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar . i think we're talking about two totally different target groups .
excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?
thank you very much .
yes , i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website .
we need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but i'm not sure how to do it .
yeah , you're right . we've got to get the most popular phrases there . how else can we boost site traffic ?
have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? who do you think is our digest threat ?
le'ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon . with them on the scene , the competition is outthrough .
thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . with competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . we need a price we can compete with .
how much do you have budgeted for our trip to las angeles ?
yes , i want to know exactly where the money is going . give me a detailed report .
so far we have $ 2 , 800 , what else ?
well , that's only $ 4000 . didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? where is the rest of the money ?
how did your company's fundraiser go ?
so how does it work ? how were you able to make money with the marathon ?
sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society .
john , i'd like to see you in my office for a minute .
john , i have been watching you . i've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and i'm impressed . you've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . i just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , i'm recommending you for promotion .
well , it's not going to be in our department . i've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . there's supervisory spot opening up in financial . i'm turning your name in for it .
what's the deal with the asia area sales ? did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ?
what do the preliminary figures tell you ? any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the far east ?
for example ?
hello , this is lucy from abc company .
good news for us . when can you start to work ?
ok , please come to my office at 9 am next monday . i will introduce you to our boss .
thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare .
it is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . they will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on friday nights . we have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . let ’ s all welcome ms . michelle cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman .
are you free next thursday ?
a bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement .
retirement age is still 65 , but i think more and more people are retiring earlier , i think bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young .
margaret , i'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . we need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . we've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .
mr hughes ? do you have a minute ? i would like to discuss something with you .
i was wondering , i have heard many of my co wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . also , i ’ ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent japanese . is that right ?
right now i ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our asian market . we have several upcoming events to take place for the japanese cities . we ’ ll be heading to tokyo next month to get things started . what i would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion .
we aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . we would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other .
how often are stockholders meetings held ?
what percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? i'm guessing not a large percentage .
so , how much say do the stockholders really have ?
please send this memo out to all the managerial staff . there will be training for all the department heads next week . attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . financial officers may participate if their schedules allow .
so tell me , what's the difference between the board of directors , the ceo , and the stockholders ? they all seems ot be the same group of people to me .
how many people are on the board of directors ?
where is the boss ? i need him to sign a few documents . i checked in his office , but he is not there . is he out of the office now ?
what's he studying ?
sounds like a tiring schedule . he ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ?
why is that ?
could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before i send it out to the human resources department ?
but languages don't have anything to do with engineering . shouldn't everything i put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
francis , what ’ s that ?
could you tell me something about it ?
how many departments do we have ?
ok . who should i report to ?
and i represent ?
ok , thank you .
hello mr . jones , please have a seat . thank you for coming in today . i have read your resume . you completed university in england ?
so , what experience do you have ?
i can see that from your resume . your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
i see . do you want to work full time or part time ?
i'll make note of that . now , what are your salary expectations ?
how long does it take to get to downtown from here ?
does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
it ’ s such a large firm . do we have our own staff restaurant ?
bob , can i talk to you for a minute ? there have been some developments for the stewart case that i really need to talk to you about .
well , i'm afraid there is . i have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests . there won't be any results .
we are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next tuesday . do you think you can handle that ?
no , i must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ?
hello ? ms . patterson ? this is bill from workmate calling . i'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate i sent for your gala dinner project next month . as i said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis .
yes , i have several copies , but they're all different versions . the latest i have is version 12 , is that current ?
i wonder if mr . smith forgot your meeting . i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . will you please have a seat ?
it is really exciting news .
you don ’ t know ? the company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones .
we will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . and if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station .
this is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . the socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient .
how come it is slow as a snail today ?
yes , i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click .
look at this survey conducted by a website . a quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . hi , francis , what about you ?
though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , i don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that .
but it is lucky for us . the company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . i have shopped too often online these days .
yes , do you mind if i have a look at your computer ?
well , it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the e mail capacity .
did you hear something ?
it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices .
well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , i think it is not reasonable . what if there are some important calls ?
yes , except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e mail box regularly .
what are in this folder ?
are they filed alphabetically ?
can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ?
a friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . he told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . he recommended me to subscribe to it . what do you say ?
well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance .
you didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . what ’ s up ?
but you still look a little bit tired . what time did you leave ?
that ’ s normal after a tense work evening . working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . once , i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later .
where were decorating and i ’ m going to ask some things .
shall we need at 1 fifteen this thursday ? we definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
good morning . i ’ m liu yi , from china xyz company . we have an appointment with mr . thomas .
thank you .
should each of us write separately ?
i am liu yi , from china xyz company . i ’ d like to see mr . thomas , please .
no , i am afraid not . i just arrive in town today .
would you please ask when he will be free ?
you must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college .
do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ?
an average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that .
but these people say nothing about that . they are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days .
i have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . i feel exhausted .
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .
i am going on a business trip to guangzhou next monday morning .
yes , as the new year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers .
sure .
no , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me .
i see . what about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ?
i will call them this afternoon , thanks .
good morning , i am monica . are you mr . white , the manager of finance department ? i am the newcomer and also working in the finance department .
thank you . i am very happy to have my own office now . i ’ ve never had one before . it is very nice .
really ? what could that be ?
hi , francis , how was your business trip ?
what ’ s up ?
sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
this is really a sad story . did they trace back your luggage ?
did you see the letter i got from bradford films ? they sent it in response to your phone call last week .
i guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the milton contract .
sure , here it is .
did they ask you to send the files beforehand ?
i don't think so , why do you ask ?
i would like to take this opportunity to welcome monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . for all of you , we hired monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . she has lots of working experiences as an accountant and i am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .
lucy , i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . would you like to help me with the ladder ?
i think i can handle it by myself .
like this one ?
yeah , thank you for telling me .
i'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , but i just don't know exactly what to say , i don't even know how to get started , i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . , but the problem is i don't know the name of contact person .
ok , so i first thanks them for their business , i can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , how is that ?
like regarding our new product line , we would like to announce a special price discount
yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . how should i write that ?
so , monica , how do you like your new office ?
that ’ s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
didn ’ t you punch in this morning , monica ?
that ’ s ok . i should have told you earlier . this is a company rule .
according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
from 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
may i ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ?
thank you for telling me that .
what are they ? i ’ ll be careful .
i got it .
we'd like to welcome everyone to the michelson tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . my name is paul shafer , i'll be showing you around today . please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , i'll be happy to answer questions for you .
that's an excellent question . i'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . the reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . as you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear .
it should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . all together our tour should last about half an hour .
our toner cartridges are already out of ink . could you make an order for a new set ?
i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? i'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , i'm pretty sure they came in last night .
yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re faxed . these copies are so dark , i can't make out any of the words .
yes , but this one will have to be re faxed as well . and look , there's about three pages missing ! it looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable !
may i help you ?
let me key in your information into my computer . i will pull up our records for you . do you have an order number ? what name is the order listed under ?
yes , mr . smith . i have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ?
is there the correct billing address ?
i will send you an invoice in the next few days . your order should be delivered before the end of the day on monday .
hello , thank you for calling bradford and sons . this is tracy speaking , how may i help you ?
just a moment . i'll check to see if she is at her desk . may i tell her who is calling ?
thank you , mr . burton . can you please hold for a moment ? i'll check to see if she is available .
excuse me , don ? i hate to bother you , but i need your help on something . do you have time to brief me on the martin account today ?
i hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are .
how about this . we can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and i'll order some chinese food for delivery . it'll be my treat .
i insist . i really appreciate you taking time to work with me in . what is your favorite fast food ? i'll cater to your taste .
this is doris . who's calling please ?
oh , i almost forgot . thank you for calling to remind me . actually . i do need to change the time of my appointment . i have a scheduling conflict . and i can't make it that early .
it would have to be after lunch . do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ?
that ’ s alright , . i think i should be able to make it at one fifteen . can you put me down for that time slot ?
hello , this is francis .
today , i am busy all day long .
that ’ s not good for me at all . it ’ ll have to be another time .
i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon .
this is today ’ s schedule . at 8 thirty am , conference with the department managers . at 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .
would you please mail these letters , lucy ?
these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters .

ok , thank you . i ’ ll look into it .
thank you . that will be all . i ’ ll take care of it .
let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
what do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
when do you find a job satisfying ?
how would your coworkers describe you ?
how would you describe your ideal job ?
why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
what makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
how do you know about this company ?
what kind of person do you think you are ?
how do you spend your leisure time ?
so , what kind of sport do you like most ?
tell me a little bit about yourself , please .
would you tell me something about your family ?
what kind of character do you think you have ?
what is your strongest trait ?
how would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
how do you get along with others ?
woo hoo ! this just might be the start of the rest of my life !
i ’ m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . i ’ ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally . and you know i can be charming in interviews . goodbye my penniless days ! hello salary and a career !
oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world .
now , miss childs passed on your resume to me and i ’ ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i ’ m quite impressed .
well yes , i do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
ah i see , so you were actually educated in europe ?
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
i see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
i ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , mr . johnson . i can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
well , as you know , i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon bons here in the united states . they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
actually , the factory is located in scotland .
that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one !
unique , aren ’ t they ? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i ’ m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis .
hello . is this ann ?
yes , it's me .
no . worse than that . i have a flu . i'm in bed with a fever .
i'd like to do it , of course . but i just can't . i'm afraid i'd fall down in the middle of it .
why not just tell him i'm sick ? i'll ring him myself this afternoon .
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway , i have a flu . i know what it is . i don't need a doctor to tell me that .
i'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
yes , that's what i plan to do . except i won't make the chicken soup . right now i don't think i could swallow more than a spoonful of it .
yeah , i'm very nauseous . it's mostly nausea and a fever .
thanks , ann . talk to you this afternoon .
excuse me , sir , this is the express check out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . it looks like you have more than fifteen items there .
fine ! please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . do you prefer paper or plastic ?
no problem , i ’ ll take those . sir , these coupons expired yesterday .
will this be debit or credit ?
oh , come on ! an excuse like that is tantamount to lying . you ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks .
our advertisement says english competence is a key requirement of this position . then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken english ?

so , lauren , i just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , jason huntley .
basically , i ’ ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , i don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company .
yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times . take last tuesday for instance , he was forty five minutes late for our morning meeting !
but that ’ s not the only thing . you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , i ’ m constantly catching him on msn and facebook when he should be talking to clients .

my work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency .
i think so .

come in , please .

i've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at peking university . will you please tell me something about your related courses ?
have you taken accounting for decision making and control ?
from your school report card , i can see you did well in every course . but our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience .
you can speak english fluently but i wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in english .
that sounds fine . why did you choose to apply to our company ?
do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ?
i hope you can show me your cpa certificate before we reach a decision by the end of july .
the same for me . we'll keep in touch with you .

my major was computer science when i was at college , and i am quite familiar with visual c + + and java language .
the developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . in some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . so i think the software industry has a great future .

hello , mr . hammer . jack ross here . i'm calling to confirm our appointment on monday at ten o'clock in your office .
i'd like to bring mr . huang and ms . sun with me .

yes .
oh , i see .
john , do you have a minute ?
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m getting at . we ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . a lot people are going in and out .
no , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to .
no , of course not . but i ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you .
oh , that would be too small .
come to think of it , you may be on to something . let ’ s go have a look .
i ’ d like to ask whether it is correct to partake in the firm ’ s insurance plan ?
we have the capital ready . right now i am looking at three different companies to produce our products . and your company , mr . chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want .
you have some doubts about our products , i understand .
of course . let me tell you in some detail about our idea . you know the popular hello kitty products .
well , the products in themselves are very simple . it is the logo that is successful . so , hello kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple .
that might be true . but we have a logo concept that is great . it is really great . i think it will catch on in taiwan at least . young people will love it . it is because of our logo that our products will sell . we just need someone to produce the products for us . we have the backup and people to do the marketing .
yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that . little accessories for young people . but the reason these will sell is the logo . just like hello kitty .
because it hasn't been copyrighted . we want to get some protection for it . but while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products .
i understand . for now , though , you could just give us an estimated price . we aren't going to sign a contract yet . we are just investigating . i only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products . and then , i only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost .
can you help me do an internet search ?
i want to find information on the american civil war .
yes , i want to know about the battle of gettysburg .
oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
thanks .

no . worse than that . i have a flu . i'm in bed with a fever .
i'd like to do it , of course . but i just can't . i'm afraid i'd fall down in the middle of it .
why not just tell him i'm sick ? i'll ring him myself this afternoon .
not yet . i feel too lousy to go out . anyway , i have a flu . i know what it is . i don't need a doctor to tell me that .
i'm not sure yet . maybe this will all be gone in a day . so it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . i will call you later this afternoon and tell you what i think .
thanks , ann . talk to you this afternoon .
in my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation .

i am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . i hope we can do business together .

i will do that . meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price .
what about the commission ? from european suppliers , i usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . it's the general practice .
you see i do business on a commission basis . a commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . even 2 or 3 % would help .

please take a seat , diana . have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
no , i ’ d prefer not . i don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
of course , diana . you'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .

is there anything else i can help you with ?
no , that is all we need . if we have those things included , that is sufficient .

if you have any further questions , you can call any time .
have you ever worked as a tour guide ?
have you applied with any other companies ?
certainly . there'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . any questions ?
all right , then . we'll get in touch with you within a week . thank you for coming today , mr . sun .
when will i get a raise ?
you said the same thing three months ago .
you mean i won't get a raise until recession ends ?
liz , do you have a minute ?
i need you to help me set up for my presentation thursday morning .
well , it isn't at this office . it's over at the dayton street office . have you been there before ?

well , i need the display monitor . but tom can set that up for me on wednesday . i will need you to help with everything else .
excuse me , i am dunlin . i am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . are there still any vacancies ?
oh , i'm so lucky . i want to apply for it .
yes . i have been a guide for two years .
i think i will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip .
no . in fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , i will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings .
this facility is great , don't you think ?
i'm glad our booth is on the first floor . more people can see our display .
let me see that . i didn't get one when i came in .
no .
where do you go for lunch around here ?
not too bad . but i will be soon .
i can't see cortex on this floor plan . don't they have a booth here ?
oh , that will be uncomfortable for them .
yes . cortex just stole darren mcdowell from rolly . and probably darren will be here . so he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old cortex coworkers .
when you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be . don ' t you think ?
yes . well , i think i'll go get lunch . will you join me ?
well , yuri , tell me about it .
that's what i was afraid of .
mud ? but ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . i thought all the mudslides were down in chichitango .
oh , that's terrible ! what bad luck ! i wish we had never come to this country . but , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes . our operations here are finished !
it's not your fault , yuri . but tell me . when will ivan be able to get out there ?
good . i want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
yes , yuri ?
has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?
are you serious ? fighting ? but i didn't hear anything on the news .
oh , this is terrible , yuri . terrible ! so we can't even assess the damages . how can we do business in this country ? either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . no , i can't believe this mess !
excuse me , can you tell me which is bob rice's office ?
yes . he told me to come by this morning .

alright .
friday is good .

yes . my name is laura wills .
thank you .
come in , arnold . have a seat .
would you like something to drink ?
i'm glad when people have new ideas around here . tell me about it .
yes .
what do you suggest ?
you mean because people have to go across town to get here .
that's true . but our staff meetings are very important , arnold . i don't know how we can function without them .
well .
you mean you want to run the meetings ?
hmm . but we would meet every two weeks .
i am not against the idea , arnold . it may really be more efficient , as you say . i'll tell you what we can do . why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
good afternoon , sales department . may i help you ?

you look tired .

oh , great , i saw a job ad outside your store . i am interested in the job advertised . i am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me .
i can do the work of shop assistant and i worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year .
at present , both are ok for me . what do you need most , then ?
it quite suits me . i am free in the evening these days , i will have no difficulty starting at five pm .
it seems reasonable . by the way , i can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't i ?

hello . i need to speak with allan cartwright .
i certainly hope so , i am about to stop doing business with your office .
excuse me , i ’ m sorry to trouble you . my name is susan ransom , and i have placed several orders with you company .
well , i wonder if you could track an order i placed with you last month . it hasn ’ t arrived yet .
print shop . seam speaking .
it usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that .
i ’ m interested in teaching at your school .
yes .
i have a tefl certificate .
i have three years of teaching esl and four years of teaching per school children .
i got my tefl certificate three years ago .
well , i ’ ve heard many good things about it . i also like teaching young children .
yes , just a little .
i sure can .
good morning , wilson association .
i'm sorry , but mr . tomas left here just a few minutes ago .
i'm afraid not . he is away for the rest of the day .
i'm afraid not , he has gone out of this town on business . may i take a message ?
i see . i'll tell mr . tomas you've called .
hello !
i'm sorry , i'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . there is no petti here .
i'm sure you have the wrong number . this one has been my number for more than 20 years .
no , it isn't . it's 736 4565 . it seems you've misdialed .
that's all right . this sort of thing happens all the time to everyone .
this is frank speaking , may i ask who is calling ?
i'm sorry , he is not here at the moment . he has gone to the international business center .
i'm not sure , he didn't say when he wound return . if you'd like . you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free .
does he have your number ?
that was 5264453 6 , right ?
i would like to take my vacation next month .
i would like to take my two weeks vacation time .
great . i will make my reservations as necessary .
i've read your report , and i'm not sure i agree with you . you think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ?
i see . so our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees .
would you consider an offer of $ 56 , 000 per year ?
our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car .
uh . not normally . what do you have in mind ?
what an interesting idea , ms . wilson . would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ?
that ’ s right i ’ m afraid i have to postpone it . mr . scott got sick and i have to attend the speechmaker ’ s symposium in his place . i ’ m leaving today , and i won ’ t be back until a week from friday .
that will be great . so it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . i ’ m really sorry to do this to you .
from reviewing your resume i can see that you have ample experience for this position . what i want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job .
so you ’ ve acquainted yourself with the company . it ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want .
commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here .
i really think if i can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . do you think you can help me polish my interview style ?
i ’ ve researched the company and think i ’ m perfect for the job but i ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .
i ’ ve just looked over your resume and i must admit i am quite impressed .
you ’ ve got plenty of training and experience . i wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . where do you see yourself ten years from now ?
interesting ! and how do you feel about decision making ? are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ?
sounds good . everyone is taking about teams these days . can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ?
i can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for corporate world unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . can you please tell me about your responsibilities ?
what , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ?
it ’ s easy enough . just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . the accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses .
yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . it ’ s not just a big vacation , you know .
comfort inn , may i help you ?
you ’ re in luck ! we ’ re just a two minute drive from there . would you like to make a reservation ?
during the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . but we ’ ve got a single super saver special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . and we ’ ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . we can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
looking through your c . v . , i see that you graduated from oklahoma state university . can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television industry ?
i see . did you have anything specific in mind ?
that ’ s impressive . how would you make that pay ?
i see you have several good ideas . now , i just have a few questions about your c . v . i notice that there is a five year gap between your last job and now .
did you pack this bag yourself ? has it been out of your possession at any time before checking in ?
are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
our sniffer dog seems to disagree . do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
what ’ s this sir ?
can you tell me a little bit about yourself ?
please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
where do you see yourself five years from now ?
good evening , sir . welcome to the comfort inn .
mmmm . i ’ m not sure if we have you down here . how do you spell your last name ?
oh , right . you ’ re in our system . i was just looking under li . so , we ’ ve got you down for a business suite for three days . if i could just have your credit card , i ’ ll process your check in while
oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . it ’ s in lieu of a deposit . if everything is ok when you check out , we give it back to you then . it ’ s pretty sta
good evening , mr . lee and thank you for choosing our airline . we have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?
from time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . that ’ s overbooked .
actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
well , first we ask for volunteers . if someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . if no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
definitely ! very relaxing .
what ? i only stayed three nights .
but your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all inclusive .
but why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 .
perhaps i could talk to your manager ?
mr . lee , all ready to check out ? we ’ ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . how will you be paying ?
that ’ s the mini bar . each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . the items you consume are put on your bill .
those are for pay per view movies . each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ?
i want some envelopes please .
the large size please . do have you any writing paper ?
yes , please . and i want some glue .
and i want a large box of chalk , too .
no , thank you .
that's all , thank you .
accounting , this is mike .
i was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . i ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . it has a lot of complicated form
ooh . sorry , that ’ s not good for me . i am tied up all day friday . we ’ ll have to do it next week . i am wide open then .
good afternoon , mr . dome ’ s office .
yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office .
yes , that ’ s correct .
hi ron , this is kim at headquarters .
great , thanks . i was calling to change our meeting next week .
well , i was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , our trip has been postponed until the 2nd .
that works for me ! i will call you when i get into town to reconfirm .
hi . i ’ m here to catch flight 513 to new york .
here you are . do you need to see my passport ?
actually it wad taken just last year , but i had a shaved head and a beard . can you still recognize me ?
yes , one suitcase . i also have a carry on bag .
hi i came in on flight 513 . everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there .
you ’ re kidding . what am i going to do ?
you can reach me at 13661306917 .
that ’ s ok . there wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . the shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage .
i would like to buy a ticket to new york please .
i ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight .
yes i know , but i just got the chance to leave and so i am going to take it no matter what .
i wish i could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket .
my return date will be the 14th .
anything but a center seat is fine with me . the middle seat drives me crazy !
will there be any layovers ?
perfect ! i ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ?
hi . i ’ m here for flight 514 returning to beijing but the board shows there is a delay . how long of a delay is expected ?
do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
what seems to be the problem ?
good morning . please come into my office .
i see that you have some impressive writing experience .
hi . i ’ m here for flight 513 to new york but i thought i heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . is that true ?
no way ! i worked very hard so that i could leave on today ’ s flight . are there seats on another airline ?
you mean the line over there of about 200 people ? !
this is a rotten way to start a vacation . i hate lines ! can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ?
we need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this .
schedule it for this afternoon , when ken gets back .
oh , that ’ s right . go ahead anyways . i ’ ll fill him in . we can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !
well , what did you think about the last candidate ? do you think we should hire her ?
what made you think that she wasn't very confident ?
she was a bit nervous , i guess . what else ?
you're right . if she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ?
i agree . i guess i was paying more attention to her answers than her body language .
business is booming . i understand you want to meet up with me next week . how ’ s your schedule looking ?
do you mind if i smoke here ?
can i just turn off the ac for now and open the window and smoke indoors ?
it ’ s very hot and that ’ s why i ’ d like to smoke inside .
have you finished going through the contract ?
ok . ask away .
yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . however , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s .
well , we ’ ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick .
do you have any other questions ?
we do actually . we can add that as an amendment to your contract .
well , women are the ones giving birth . i think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ?
do you have a minute ?
i've made a tough decision , sir . here's my resignation .
i'm afraid not , sir . i've made up my mind . it's something i have to do .
oh , no . not at all .
no , sir .
oh , no . i would never look for another job while working here . i think this is a fantastic place to work .
it's my mother . she's sick and needs someone to take care of her . i'm the only one who can do it .
really ? i didn't know that would be possible .
how was your day ?
it was really busy . i had to work straight through my lunch break .
my boss told me that i could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so i decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time .
let ’ s get back to you . how was your day ?
you look pretty upset . are you ok ?
what ’ s that ?
you ’ re kidding ! how did that happen ?
how late were you ?
you got fired for being a few minutes late ?
are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ?
have you updated your cv ?
amelia , could you spare a few minutes ?
well , i wanted to let you know that i've put in my notice .
it's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i can't continue working for a company that may let me go .
well , to be honest , there's another reason . i've got a better offer .
the head office is in new york , but i'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .
i have . i feel lucky . i look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use english more .
of course i can . in fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , i'll recommend you personally .
are you ready for the meeting ?
it's challenging , but i'm enjoying it quite a bit .
thanks a lot .
well , that's part of the problem . his probation period is up tomorrow and i don't think he's ready to pass .
well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing .
to be honest , he has no authority . he's a hard worker , but no one listens to him .
hello ?
good morning .
oh . i had hoped she would have called me back yesterday .
is there someone else i can talk to ?
any time after 2 pm today would be good for me .
i'd prefer to speak with ms . fonda .
fine . how ’ s your job going ?
really ? that ’ s fantastic . what kind of business is it ?
how ’ s it going ?
that ’ s such great news . i ’ m really happy for you ! where is your office located ?
where will those be located ?
when will you find out ?
well , good luck . i hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
how's your new job going ?
how are you finding your new boss ?
would you rather have her or your old boss back ?
how about your new co workers ?
do you miss your old co workers ?
do people in different departments get along with each other ?
do you like working in teams with people from different departments ?
do you like working in teams ?
how's your job search going ?
i see . have you found anything that you're interested in ?
what kind of job are you looking for ?
there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ?
that's a good idea . you have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ?
it's a job at a recruitment agency .
well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . i think you'd be the perfect person for the job !
i don ’ t know what i ’ m going to do ! it ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if i lose my job !
it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , onc small mistake can cost the company millions .
that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . there ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . i ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing i can do about tha
i have enough to live off of for about 3 months . but i really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! i ’ d rather invest my money somehow .
hi , jane . how are you doing this morning ?
hi there ! my name ’ s terry graham . you ’ re new around here , huh ?
well , if there ’ s anything i can do for you , let me know .
hi , my name's abby . what's your name ?
i'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ?
what kind of job are you looking for ?
have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ?
not if you are good at net working . do you like to meet new people ?
do you have experience in the it field ?
do you speak spanish ?
that's ok . have you sent your cv out to anyone yet ?
did you write a clear objective in your resume ?
i think you need to update your cv . bring it over to my office tomorrow and i'll help you with it .
everything has been fine for the past several months .
as you know , table manners in china are quite different from those of westerners .
for example , in china , it's okay to talk while eating . however , you may regard it as rude .
can you think of anything else ?
i didn't know that before .
i got it . i'll bear it in mind .
that's good . don't forget to design the format . an attractive format is as important as the content .
good . how about your cover letter ?
no , a cv is not enough . you should also attach it with a cover letter . don't overlook it . you're faced with fierce competition in the job market . if your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of
yes , you're right . all your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview .
i just received a phone call for an interview next week .
thank you , but i'm nervous . i don't know what to do . could you tell me what should i do before an interview ?
then what should i do when i'm being interviewed ?
are there any other things i should pay attention to ?
why ?
that's true . beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country .
well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities .
one person ? how about your girlfriend ?
sorry to hear that . it seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home .
do you have s second ?
i want to tell you i've put in my notice .
i've been thinking about this for several months , well before the spring festival holidays .
yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , i want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . i've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and i still haven't received
that's exactly why i decided to quit the job and find a new one .
that's right . i am not the only one who has done this . job hopping is quite common in the it industry .
what did you do at the office today ?
what kind of things did you need to check ?
i see . did anything else happen ?
it must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client .
i hate dealing with complaints . was it a legitimate complaint ?
you certainly had a busy day .
how time flies ! we have been in beijing for almost 4 years .
yeah , feels like yesterday . now i ’ m almost settled down here . we ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot .
thank you . is your company going to move to other cities ?
why is that ?
yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle .
i understand your position . perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . you ’ ll feel much better with your family around .
okay , well i ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
yes , of course . that's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150 , 000 hk dollars per annum . this doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al
well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . but we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
well rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ?
well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . miss childs will call you to discuss more on monday or tuesday . how does that so
the pleasure ’ s all mine , rebecca .
i see . and how about the working hours ?
well i am used to that , mr . parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .
and when do you need to fill the vacancy , mr . parsons ?
okay , now i ’ d like to find out more about your last job . i see you spent almost four years at the london weekly , is that right ?
so , what changed ?
i see , so why did you decide to leave finally ?
okay rebecca , well i think you ’ ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses .
definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ?
well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ?
okay , rebecca . now you ’ ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? how would you describe your key strengths ?
yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ?
what would you say is your most positive quality ?
now , if i look here i see that you completed a ba in english ?
yes , i ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
what did that involve ?
certainly . and after your internship ?
yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right .
hi . could you give me a hand with this report ?
thanks . would you mind taking a look at the layout ? do you think it ’ s appropriate ? i want it to be formal , but not boring to look at .
that ’ s an excellent suggestion . i can easily do it on the computer .
i ’ ll take that suggestion too . how about the content ?
is it ok to include the pictures ?
we ’ ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . we don ’ t want to make any mistakes .
that ’ s right . we ’ ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s
that ’ s true . right . i ’ m going back to the meeting . it ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon .
i ’ ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines .
hello . how was the marketing meeting ?
i ’ m surprised to hear that . i thought you had some very good suggestions .
so what happened in the meeting ?
i wonder why not . we could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections .
is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? if they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . you won ’ t get credit for ide
what do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ?
so , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ?
how can a business maximise revenues ?
what else do you suggest ?
we ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ?
see julie , the receptionist . she knows where all that stuff is kept . you might like a calendar for you desk . she can give you one of those too .
the photocopier is near my office . come on , i ’ ll show you where it is .
yes , i do . everyone ’ s really friendly . sometimes , i wish i worked outdoors more , especially during the summer .
what ’ s your working day like ?
do you get paid onetime ?
do you have any breaks ?
my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?
yes , i do . i don ’ t like it very much .
that ’ s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we ’ ll need someone to hire staff .
yes . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd .
the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any contracts yet ?
when will the branch office open ?
welcome to abc electronics . first , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday .
that ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . the lunch break is flexible . you can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
of course . the main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . we even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early .
you should attend a department meeting every monday morning . there are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee
you are entitled to a company car . have you seen it yet ?
then , i ’ ll see you next week , ms . o ’ brian ?
can you squeeze me in sometime today ?
i know what you ’ re saying , but i have to go over the books with you before i go see our tax guy .
excuse me , mr . rodriguez ? could i speak with you for a moment ?
well , i ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right .
i ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , mr . cranial . i ’ d like to accommodate you , but i just don ’ t think i ’ ll have the time .
not at all , sir . i ’ d just like to push it up to next week . i ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week .
mr . reynolds ? rick murphy . i ’ m the accounting manager for macmillan and emory , incorporated .
i would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account .
thank you , sir . sorry to trouble you .
when are you going to give me those brochures ?
i know , but i want to make reservations this week .
hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ?
yes , i pretty much understand the company .
yes , i've been observing them .
i already have something to wear .
ok , i am ready to think of other things .
i am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview .
no , i probably need to do some more research .
i think that their attitude is rather casual .
i have absolutely nothing so far .
yes , where should we go from here ?
richard ? do you have the number for that chinese restaurant on the corner ?
553 2213 . great , thanks .
thank you so much for interviewing me this evening .
i like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group .
i want to grow in my job and move ahead .
i need to stay in the area because of my family .
75 , 000 per year .
can you help me plan the office party ?
i need help with food .
i think it should be casual .
i would prefer chinese food for this party .
i think we should hire a live band .
could i meet with you to discuss the project ?
tuesday would be good for me .
i think the afternoon would be best .
i feel that the whole committee needs to be there .
yes , i know how to get there on my own .
i would like to meet on monday .
i want to come in the morning .
yes , i can bring the outline when i come to the meeting .
i think that we should have just the sub committee .
no , i need directions , please .
will you tell me the situation ?
and then ?
i'm afraid you must give up the cash . are you insured ?
do you remember me ? i just had lunch here a half hour ago .
i think i lost my wallet here .
really ? you didn't find a wallet ?
yes , i would . it's not here . and it's not on the floor . has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
hmm . i don't know how it could have happened .
no . my friend did .
no , i'm not sure . but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down . it ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . so i usually put it next to me on the table .
i don't think it's at home . i think i had it when i left the house . but what should i do ?
should i call the police ?
hmm . i'll go home and check . maybe you're right . maybe it's at home .
oh , my god ! what's this ?
look ! this window is open .
are you kidding ? it's winter . why would i open it ?
i locked it when i left though .
i don't care about that , allen ! what did he steal ? that's the question !
the tv's still here .
but what if someone's still up there ?
there's someone coming .
yes , it's fast . but four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage .
i wonder if anyone can call the ridleys about this . do you know them well ?
do you know where they're vacationing ?
hi ! what are you watching ?
wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ?
why do they go there ?
when muslims pray , they face towards mecca .
i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .
do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
are you watching another news report about the war ?
how did this war start ?
politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . neither side wants to compromise .
what do you think will happen ?
why are you holding me in this jail cell ?
what do you think are the main causes of war today ?
it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
how do you think they could be ended ?
so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them .
yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
hey man , you wanna buy some weed ?
weed ! you know ? pot , ganja , mary jane some chronic !
i also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
come on man ! i even got dope and acid ! try some !
i got my connections ! just tell me what you want and i ’ ll even give you one ounce for free .
yeah ?

good morning , and welcome to our bank . what can i do for you today ?
what seems to be the problem ?
i see . well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . which would you prefer ?
not a problem . but may i just inform you that we have introduced a new service called account renewing upon maturity ?
you see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . all you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you .
hello . did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ?
of course . as we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us .
there are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . it's specific to different accounts and different circumstances .
there's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates .
yes , it sure does . and with our new premises , we have new services . we can provide 24 hour support for your wealth management .
welcome to no bank . it's mr zu , isn't it ?
how's mrs zu doing these days ?
can i give you some advice on a loan , or .
are you absolutely sure , mr zu ? you know , you will lose interest if you do .
good afternoon , mr meng . it's a little late for you , isn't it ?
what can i help you with ?
mmmm . yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . too risky ! how about open ended funds ?
exactly . then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . and , we provide a professional fund manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us .
right , let me run through your options . you can go ahead and cash your undue large amount deposit certificate if you really want to , but i'd recommend a personal durable commodities loan .
it's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . if you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
not at all , mr zu . as the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
exactly right . if you'd like to go ahead , i can process that for you now , mr zu .
hello , and welcome to iba . which service do you require ?
that's no problem ; i can take care of that for you .
if it's this kind of consultancy service , i'll have to direct you to another department , i'm afraid .
there are many services you can choose from . why don't you take a look at this leaflet while i find someone who can help you ?
consumer credit department . how may i help you ?
that's excellent . well , for our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates . the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years .
of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 year loan is 5 . 29 %
we usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . and since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan .
welcome to iba consumer credit . what can i assist you with ?
that's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . that's why we have just started a new scheme ; a personal automobile consumer loan .
what we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . if it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us .
yes . when you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . as long as you provide the proper documentation , of course .
hi , buddy ! how do you deal with your salary ?
look ! this stock is rising now . i am researching it , and planning to buy some shares .
no . this is my first time to buy some . you can see that its historical price data is rising now .
hey ! do you still remember our teacher of economics , mr . locker ?
this is lincoln bank , consumer credit department . how can i help you ?
we offer a personal automobile consumer loan . the application process is pretty straight forward . i trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so .
that will certainly cut down the processing time . we can move on to the next step . do you have the purchase price ?
what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , id card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .
are you an existing customer ?
that's very sensible of you . we have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments .
would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ?
well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20 , 000 rib , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80 , 000 rib .
it's all about credit rating and salary . if your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card .
yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts .
welcome to lincoln bank . what can we do for you ?
well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card .
you know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month .
yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment .
yes . as long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly .
for example , if your credit limit is 5 , 000 rib and you owe 1 , 000 rib , your available credit will be 4 , 000 rib . so , your credit limit drops .
right . well , the benefits are a little different . with our corporate card you can use it for agency collection and payment .
there's quite a long list , actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments .
if you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions .
it's mrs bardot , isn't it ?
i'm greg wu , head of consultancy . i see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . is that right ?
i see . so , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ?
i couldn't agree more . if you have the company details with you i can get on with that right away . is there anything else that you need from us today ?
we do indeed . such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested .
how so ?
we are able to do credit investigations globally . you have no need to worry .
10 years ago , maybe yes . but nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country .
welcome to iba . what can we assist you with today ?
this scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks .
may i have your details , and i'll check for you .
ok , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card .
hello ! so , you're back . do you have everything with you ?
and also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number .
what's the purpose for this check ? would you like to know its repayment capacity ?
as it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . there is , of course a service fee of 300 rib to be paid .
good morning , sir . can i help you with something ?
that's right . but don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure .
yes , please . that's being processed now . as soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card .
iba , jane speaking . how can i help you ?
sorry , i'm not quite sure if i understand . in what way , sir ? has your card been stolen ?
sorry , sir , but it's 5 working days . this does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
it's no trouble at all , sir . is there anything else i can help you with today ?
hello , this is lucie jing calling from lincoln bank . may i speak to mr was , please ?
ah , hello , mr was . i'm just calling about your new credit card . it has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you .
what perfect timing !
not really . but we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with .
that will be sent on to you within 2 working days . then , you can start using your new card .
how can i help you this afternoon ?
unfortunately , an atm is being refilled because it ran out of money . that's what's causing the hold up .
you are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ?
thank you . and you require .
please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . and sign here , please .
thank you . here's your card back and your money . please double check it for me .
good afternoon . this is michelle li speaking , calling on behalf of iba . is mr meng available at all ?
oh , hello ! sorry about that . i'm just calling to say that we've received your new corporate credit card from hq .
yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast track system .
or we can send it to you . but if you would like to use it at the atm , you'll need to wait for your pin number .
as long as you bring your id , etc , we can serve you over the counter . but you won't be able to use the atm until your new pin number arrives .
good morning . madam . what can i do for you today ?
what seems to be the problem ?
oh ? you mean , the atm machine has eaten it ?
you said you received your card this morning , am i right ?
did you receive your pin number yet , madam ? you see , unless you have your new pin number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . we usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
welcome to iba . what can i do for you today ?
no problem . could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ?
yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . we will be putting in a new atm in the near future , though . that should help to ease the queues .
i know what you mean . how much would you like to deposit with us today ?
that's correct , 1 , 000 rib . i'll need your personal code to deposit this . could you enter it on this key pad , please ?
welcome . what can i do for you this morning ?
well , welcome to our country . i trust you are having a pleasant stay ?
that's the opinion of most people . do you have your passport with you ? i'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form .
how much would you like to withdraw ?
that's fine .
here's your money , your card and your passport . please double check the amount for me .
welcome . what can i do for you , madam ?
that's terrible . unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . what i'd advise you to do is set up a direct debit service .
a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
welcome to lincoln bank . what can i help you with , sir ?
unfortunately , no , i can't . but our specialist can . please take a seat and our mortgage adviser will come out to see you .
no problem , sir . he'll be with you in just a minute . could i get you something to drink while you are waiting ?
i'm the mortgage advisor at this branch . you wanted a chat about housing loans ?
i see . it's a problem most of us face . may i ask what the purchase price is ?
so , you've already made a large initial deposit ? that is good news . ok , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started .
welcome to iba . do you need any assistance ?
i see . we offer personal housing loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0 . 42 % per month .
we offer many different payment plans . would you be looking at long term or short term ? are you looking at a 10 year repayment plan ?
then we can certainly help you with that . you see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate .
may i help you at all ?
we certainly do . i can give you some details about a loan called personal loan for studying abroad . we offer this to anyone who will study outside this country .
this loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items .
that's right . the sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . the guidelines are not so strict , you see .
good day ! what can we do for you ?
buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs .
with our personal automobile consumer loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price .
personal loans , how may i help ?
not exactly . our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse .
ok , that's absolutely fine . i will need to see some credentials before we can get started . do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ?
you do , i'm afraid . there are 3 ways to do this . you can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode .
right , that's no problem . i see you are already well informed . if you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees .
did you need help with something ?
i can help you with that .
i work here .
may i see your id ?
all right , here is your ballot card .
go to a voting booth and vote .
are you planning on voting ?
yes , but this will be my first time voting .
i don ’ t know any of the laws they ’ re trying to pass .
i didn ’ t know that .
that ’ s good to know .
are you going to vote ?
yes , and for the first time .
i don ’ t know how to vote .
i ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on .
thanks for telling me .
will you be voting this year ?
this is going to be my first time voting .
i ’ m not sure what i ’ m doing .
nobody told me that before .
i ’ m so glad you told me that .
i am really excited !
i just got done voting .
i just turned 18 last month .

i didn ’ t think of it that way .
seriously , but i ’ m excited that i did .

i ’ m shocked he actually won .
what about him being black ?
i am so excited !
i just voted .
why is that ?
i didn ’ t think about it like that .
i voted today .
i just turned 18 a month ago .
what do you mean ?
i really didn ’ t , but i ’ m still excited .
who was your vote for president ?
i didn ’ t expect him to win .
i thought his race would have kept him from winning .
that ’ s true .
just one second , and i'll check .
union bank . how can i be of service ?
i'll need your name and account number .
you voted , right ?
who did you vote for ?
can you believe that he actually won ?
i didn ’ t think he would .
i figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s african american .
hello , there . you are looking a little confused ; can i help you with something ?
don't worry ; i can help you with that . i understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . the first thing we need to do is check the atm is in service . this one is fine .
yes , this one is in service . put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . then you will see some instructions on the screen .
and press ' enter ' to confirm , here . now you need to decide which service you need .
i hope you can help . i've got a bit of a problem with your atm .
well , it's eaten my card ! it won't give it back !
yes . i was only entering my pin . i'm terrible at remembering it , i'm so forgetful , you see .
maybe three times . as i said , i always forget it .
oh , i see . so if i call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
welcome to the electronic age ! i can run you through it ; it's what i'm here for .
just look at the screen here . it'll give you prompts , you see ? now you need to enter your pin number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it .
not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . the next thing is to select the service .
yes , then enter the amount you want .
hello , mr kowalski ?
which city are you staying in right now ? and the name of your hotel ?
do you have your passport with you ? or do you by any chance know the number ?
let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . that's just what i've done , mr kowalski , i've stopped your card temporarily .
you can go to any branch of iba and request the emergency assistance service . everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry .
iba , client services department . shelley speaking , how can i help ?
calm down , sir . is that an iba debit or credit card ?

ok , that's fine , sir . we just need to ask you some questions for security purposes .
could i have your name , please ? and do you know your card number ?
that should be fine , mr kowalski . and your pin number ?
welcome to lincoln bank . which service do you require today ?
we have many loans on offer . may i ask what the purpose of the loan is ?
i see . what you need is one of our petty consumer loans .
certainly . it's quite simple really . do you hold a resident's permit ?
that's great . we'll also need details of your occupation .
welcome to lincoln bank . are you a new customer ?
i see . as you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you .
may i ask why you decided to switch your account to us ?
we always welcome new business . if you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin .
as an existing banker , that will speed up the process . you said you had the documents with you ?
you are authorized to borrow up to 20 , 000 rib , with a repayment period of up to 1 year .
we can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly .
if you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week .
good afternoon . what can i do for you today , madam ?
ok , madam . we are here to help .
i understand completely . there are other options , such as a personal pledge loan .
the procedure is really simple and convenient . all you need to do is fill in this loan application form .
of course , we'll need some documentation from you . like your resident permit , proof of salary and your usd deposit certificate , to use as collateral .
welcome back , sir . i trust the materials were helpful to you ?
your credit is fine , sir . now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ?
i see . and what loan amount are you expecting ?
i'm sorry , sir . the maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20 , 000 rib , with no exceptions .
i need some documentation from you . such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and i already have your credit details here .
loans department , how can i help you ?
certainly , sir . i'd be happy to . the personal pledge loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , time deposits , for example , or visible treasury bonds .
that's correct , sir . the bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities .
the maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral .
the initial amount is just 2 , 000 rib , but we can go up to 100 , 000 rib . but remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral .
hello , this is iba bank . maria speaking , how may i help ?
not a problem . which loan was it you were interested in ? sorry , i must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for .
one of our most popular ! the usual interest rate is fixed by the pbc . that is the people's bank of china . but of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too .

well , corporate agreement savings will be based on the agreement deposit contract signed by the customer and the bank together . so , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . so , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of current deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal .
if it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the people's bank of china on the day you wish to settle or withdraw .
after you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead .
it is higher than the rate of interest for current deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 month time deposits .

hello . may i help you ?
let me find that on my screen . yes , the l / c is right here . i'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet .

hello , sir . what can we do for you today ?
now , you can do it via our atms . it's convenient and easy to use . and we have 4 machines in this branch , so the queues are not usually very long .
good afternoon , lincoln corporate services . lina speaking , how may i help ?
that's not a problem , i'm more than happy to explain everything in laymen's terms . pin stands for personal internet banking . you can do all of your usual banking using the internet , no need to call
we can take care of that for you , too . you can get all of your usual banking services plus some new extra ones . as this service is net bases , you can do it anywhere .
iba , how can i help ?
that was a wise decision , if i may say so . our personal internet banking service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management .
hi , sir . what can i do for you ?
right . if the cheque is coming from the us , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear .
good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . have you decided to go ahead and try for the fixed asset loan ?
that depends . our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . the fixed asset loan is a long term loan , you see . the loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs .
you will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due .
no problem at all . with this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ?
select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here . then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu . ok , good . then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference .
which type of telephone bill would you like to pay today ?
i'll need your bank card , please . your bank book is required for over the counter services ; with the atm you just need to have your card .
hello , there . welcome , and what can we assist you with ?
yes , we can do that . we require the original trading contract and also the vat invoice and the commodity delivery documents . they all need to be in duplicate .
do you have a copy of the id card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? the legal rep , i mean ? we also need the loan certificate as well . do you have that ?
the atm machine outside won't give me back my card .
yes , here it is .
how did you know ?
oh . but can i have my card back now ?
mr ludlow , hello . it's good to see you again . what can we do for you today ?
no problem . could i please see the bill and all of the other documents ?
there's no problem here , everything's in order . i can transact that for you now .
i would like to open a checking account at this branch .
i do , at a different location , i have a savings account and a cd .
here is my driver's license . will that work ?
business please . and i want the most simple one you have .
hello , back already ? that was quick !
great . i shall also need a copy of your own id and the warrant letter , you can fill in one here .
hello , is everything alright ? can i help ?
similar to a promissory note , yes . i can deal with that for you right here . the difference between a promissory note and a bill of exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation .
that's right . we didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . so , we become involved .
is there anything else , apart from the credit rating and debt to asset ratio ?
right , ok . that , again , shouldn't be a problem .
well , as far as i can tell , we qualify .
what can i do for you , madam ?
certainly , madam . what would you like to know ?
good afternoon , sir . you're here to see about a temporary loan , right ? the loans we offer are for purchasing income generating assets . is that what you require ?
well , we offer 60 day or 90 day loans . the balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
unfortunately , not .
hello . i'm duty manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ?
yes , sir . we can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , temporary working capital loans , short term working capital loans and mid term working capital loans .
which one interests you , sir ?
hello . what can we do for you ?
certainly . that shouldn't be a problem . tell me , do you have a basic account with us ?
oh , that's good . we will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability .
hi there . welcome to lincoln corporate services . how can we help ?
welcome to iba . what can we do for you ?
if you think it will be very short term , i would recommend you go with the 60 day loan . then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future .
mr brown ! how nice to see you , can i help ?
i see . you are one of my favourite customers , mr brown . i'm more than happy to help . for comprehensive credit granting , iba will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch .
hello . how can we be of service ?
ok , are you already an account holder ?
to find out if you are eligible for our fixed asset loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure .
welcome to iba . can i help you ?
ok , just a moment . yes , it has arrived . the amount is 51 , 998 us dollars net , 12 us dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank .
hello , fife computers . how can i help ?
oh , really ? do you know which company they are from ?
what's the charge for that ?
it certainly is . do you have your contract and import license ?
thanks . what you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us .
next , please .
how much do you like to exchange ?
right , i will exchange for you now . please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
ok , wait for a moment . well , i am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . in this case , you'd better change 2 , 000 $ to swiss francs .
please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
good afternoon , mr meng ! it's nice to see you today . it's been a while , hasn't it ?
right . do you have the code for that one ?
hello .
yes , please . i'd like to open a savings account . would you please give me some advice ?
what's the difference between the two ?
then how about the current account ?
thank you for your help . i think i'll open a current account .
yes .
thank you very much .
welcome to iba . can i help you ?
thanks . i'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . there is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before i can process it for you .
hello , sir . what can we do for you today ?
l / c stands for ' letter of credit ' . this is necessary for trade between two countries . a letter of credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too .
hello , sir . how can we help you today ?
ok , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms , way bills , bills of lading , customs forms , various certificates .
hello . is everything ok , there ?
what seems to be the problem ?
that's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . we usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular .
i would recommend it , yes . then you just need to complete that form .
good afternoon . may i help you ?
which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ?
okey . the interest rate for time deposit is higher . could you tell me it's rib deposit or currency deposit ?
is it your first time to make a deposit here ?
all right . just a moment , please .
hello . what can i do for you today ?
really ? have you checked everything carefully ?
ah , i see . the goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ?
usually , if the problem is insignificant i advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . but this does seem a little more serious . i suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . hopefully you can sort it out over the phone .
hello , welcome to lincoln bank . what can we do for you today ?
no problem . ok . just checking for you . ah , i'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . what you can do is buy some us dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
hello , welcome to the international business counter , sir . what can we do for you today ?
you will need to return the documents . that's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now .
good afternoon . welcome to lincoln bank , how can we be of service ?
just pulling up your information now . yes , some documents arrived for you from sapporo .
actually , there is a problem . it's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes .
ah yes , the ones from sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ?
well , we were contacted by your manager and he said .
the customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a discrepancy fee of 100 us dollars .
good morning , mr bell . how are you today ? are you here to sort out your l / c documents ?
i see , here it says km509 .
welcome to iba . how can i help you ?
jd185649000023 ? yes , found it . 175 , 000 euros , is that correct ? jd185649000023 ?
yes , you can . just wait a moment and i'll do that for you now .
good morning , sir . are you here to get some advice about our new personal financing program ?
the account is a compound savings account , which is in rib and forex .
yes , you can have a money link card . you can also base the account on time deposits . the choice is yours .
the interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our personal financing .
yes , you can have multi accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits .
hello , there . what can we do for you today ?
yes , that's right . we have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already .
right again . we can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the stock exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments .
good afternoon , you look a little stuck . can i help ?
i see . what is it exactly that you are interested in ?
for the savings deposit you could actually get more . you see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1 . 58 % after the 20 % interest tax . so , technically you could get more than a third more .
good day . welcome to iba , what can i assist you with today ?
yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our personal financing program .
for every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both .
hello , madam . what can we do for you today ?

you're right , no problems . you are becoming quite the expert , mr lawson . if any problem does turn up , which i'm sure it won't , i'll give you a call .
good morning , felix wasserman associates . beth jennings speaking .
hello , mr hong . what can i do for you ?
that's great ! that was quick , after it not being there yesterday i wasn't expecting to hear from you for a while .
are you the loan officer of this bank ?
i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about a loan i want to make .
500 dollars , please .
ok . thank you for your help . that's very nice of you .
what can i do for you ?
you begin by applying for a corporate charter . and then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right .
ok .
excuse my troubling you . you purchased our products last year and now i am following up to find out about their workings . are they still in good condition now ?
that's it ! all of them have first class quality and performance . besides , we adopt advanced technology . now we have developed new products . they are much better than what you have bought .
that's great ! thanks for your support . if any , please remember to call us . i am afraid i have to say goodbye now ! bye , mr . james !
may i help you ?
yes . our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange .
we can change only three kinds of currency , usd , japanese yen and hk dollar in our savings office .
the buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
please go to counter no . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . it's over there .
what else , ma'am ?
let me show you to the cashier's . it's 905 yuan in total .
oh , it's a service charge .
sorry , but we can't do that . it's store's rule .
yes .
here is the receipt . wanna to have it wrapped , ma'am ?
it'll be great to have you again .
i'd like to open a one year time deposit account and a checking account .
okay , here are the forms . can i use traveler's checks to open the account ?
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
please fill out this deposit form , first .
no , that's fine . do you bring your bankbook with you ?
wait a moment , please .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
the deposit rate is 0 . 8 % every month .
good morning . may i help you , sir ?
do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ?
good morning , may i help you ?
please fill out this form , please .
yes . you must put on its name and full address .
let me check . yes . your one thousand remittance , please .
this rate is one percent . that will be 10 yuan .
generally it will arrive within a week .
no . that's all . you have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order .
could you do something to advance your time of shipment ?
i hope you'll try to convince them to step up production .
well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . what's your last word as to the date then ?
all right . i'll take you at your word . may i suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on october 15th or earlier ? our letter of credit will be opened early september .
that's very considerate of you . and now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ?
i suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account .
then please cover w . p . a . and tend for this transaction .
is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ?
that might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . what about free delivery ? if we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ?
it's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . they reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . to our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . we can't accept them in this state . they are unfit for human consumption . and the medical officer of health has issued a stop notice on them .
certainly . here's a survey report by a well known lab in london , whose testimony is absolutely reliable .
the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
we've already got in touch with the underwriter . but they have refused to accept any liability . they attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage .
to my regret , we failed to cover contamination . this is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
it's 1 australian dollar to 6 . 1 yuan rib .
the rate was 1 australia dollar to 6 . 5 yuan yesterday .
i don't know , sir . but it won't change much .
okay . please sign here in this form .
here is the 6 , 100 rib .
when it comes to select a fund , you will always read past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ?
if you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns .
everyone wants to be financial lose kill . you must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . i ’ m thinking about buying stocks . it can be a good investment if i can manage well . what do you say ?
wow , you sound very professional .
i ’ m going to place a trial order for 1 , 000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense .
your price is reasonable but i wonder if you would give us a discount . you know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from european suppliers .
discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products .
as far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . and generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . i hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements .
1 % ? that ’ s too low a rate . could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? .
it seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . i ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail .
we spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . we don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits .
that ’ s great . i ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . i ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning .
i really like what you have . but the price for this product is much higher than we expected . i am absolutely not a buyer at that price .
i understand that . if you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now .
err , well , i can ’ t decide right now . do you mind if i have a small internal discussion on this first ? i will tell you our decision this afternoon .
are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ?
what if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ?
therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade .
i ’ ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .
why , your price has soared . it ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
i ’ m afraid i can ’ t agree with you there . i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ ve received from other sources .
i wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . it's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers .
but we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know .
i hope we could offer the most favorable terms .
good . is there any commission included ? we are commission agents .
ok . how about the earliest possible shipment ?
could you make an offer on fob basis ?
shall we discuss the packing ? you know , a well designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . i'd like to see the sample of packing .
quite good . the beautiful design and bright color are just the european taste . how are you gonna pack these blouses ?
mr . black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ?
i am afraid shipment by early may would be too late for us . our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . the fertilizers must be delivered before april , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing .
we are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet .
10 , 000 sq . m . you should give us a discount for such a large quantity .
the iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . no doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business .
we'd better cover the porcelain ware against all risks .
i'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount .
i am afraid i have some bad news for you . it's about our order contract o5tswal .
the goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . what's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged .
but then there were some cracks in a number of cases . almost all the bottom of the cases were loose .
but our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing .
but you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . when they were rehandled , some of them were broken .
what's your main range ?
i am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . i think some of these items will find a ready market in canada . but what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .
i am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ?
in that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling .
first , the languages on the label should be in both english and french . second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ?
the brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel .
welcome to china , mr . white .
welcome to this corporation , mr . white . won ’ t you please sit down ?
our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the oct . exhibition there . now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind .
good . well , mr . white , most of the items listed are available this year . i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery .
here are our catalog and price list . the catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles .
we normally export cfr .
that can be discussed .
what about tomorrow morning at 9 ? i'll come over to your hotel .
at sight of course .
we ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . you don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . the usual percentage is around 85 .
yes . we usually send technicians abroad to offer after sales service to our customers .
if i remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ .
ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of sep . we'd like them to be there in time for our christmas sales .
but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before dec . 25 .
i hope you'll try to get them to step up production .
if that's the case , there is nothing more to be said .
what's your last word as to the date then ?
all right . i'll take you at your word .
can you find some way for an earlier delivery ?
sounds like a good idea .
i've come about your wools . according to our market survey , wools are likely to find a ready market in our country .
do you quote cif or fob ?
could you quote the price of cif hamburg ?
could you adopt d / a or d / p ? you see i have to pay a deposit when i open a letter of credit . that will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order .
anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . we've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . it would help me greatly , if you could accept d / a or d / p . it makes no difference to you , but it does to me .
what kind of document is an invoice ?
how many kinds of foreign invoices are there ?
what does the price in different kinds of invoices include ?
hey , daughter . let me ask you something .
do you have life insurance ?
you have children now . what if something , god forbid , happens to you ?
how are your stocks doing , jim ?
yeah , i lost money investing in the internet too .
the city bank . may i help you , sir ?
may i have your name , please ?
alright , what's your address ?
when would you like your account closed ?
oh , such a variety . all of them are excellent both in color and flavour . no wonder our people like china ’ s tea better than any other kind . could you give me some idea of the prices ?
yes . i want 500 kilograms of black tea from anti , 200 kilograms of jasmine tea from hangzhou and 100 kilograms of crushed black tea , first grade .
good morning , madam . can i help you ?
may i have your name , please ?
if the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . but if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week .
could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ?
hello ! how can i help you , sir ?
do you qualify for any of the federal loan programs ?
well . in that case we can offer you a private educational loan .
it's 7 . 2 % , fixed rate loan .
just fill out this application . we can let you know right away if you qualify .
good afternoon , miss . what can i do for you ?
just a moment , please . your name ?
here is your balance .
here you go , miss .
i'd like to apply for a credit card . can you help me with my application ?
i'm afraid that i don't have a credit history . i just came to this country .
i'm afraid not .
what is the interest rate on your card ?
that's very expensive !
how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
does the card provide any other benefits ?
hello , may i help you ?
of course . we would be happy to cash it for you .
well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . you see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest .
no , madam . not very much .
yes , i'll be happy to cash these for you . would you please countersign them here ?
put on the helmet , please .
you ’ d better , to protect your clothes . now please watch your step .
well , not fully automated .
one thousand units per month now . but we ’ ll be making 1 , 200 units beginning with october .
about 2 % in normal operations .
how large is the plant ?
it ’ s much larger than i expected . when was the plant set up ?
congratulations !
how many employees do you have in this plant ?
does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ?
it was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . it gave me a good idea of your product range .
very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your nw model .
the machine gives you an edge over your competitors , i guess .
could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible .
i'm pleased to meet you again , mrs . king .
you've had a good trip , i hope .
it's been a full two years since we last saw each other .
we shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . you've done very well in fulfilling the agreement .
yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . we can see you are experienced in this particular line .
but i think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in canada is rather conservative . after all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . you can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .
500 pieces .
all right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . and for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .
we would like to make a specific mention of one more point . as our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re export our goods to any other area outside your own .
another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .
good , that's all then .
i think you know already that i want to discuss the represent ton for your alarm clocks .
is that so ? anyhow i want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . our firm specializes in this line of business . we have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the european market .
in some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents . generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . we are paid for our service , of course .
yes , our commission is very reasonable . we usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news papers and tv programs . a 10 % commission will not leave us much .
we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar ante anything , at least not to begin with .
do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
oh , that's just too bad . i intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
ah , mrs . miller , but in this case am i covered ?
all right , but i'll be back again for the autumn fair . and then i hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
this is our rock bottom price , mr . li . we can't make any further concessions .
what i mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
what is your proposal ?
do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible .
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that'll definitely be rock bottom .
you certainly have a way of talking me into it . all right , let's meet half way again .
yes , there's one other point i wish to clear up .
yes , of course . i'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . when do we meet again ?
first of all , i would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . i hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us .
i would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . the styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market .
i understand you are selling the same products to some other australian importers . this tends to complicate my business . as you know , i am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole sabers and retailers in that line . i have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . one of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . as it is to our mutual interests and profit , i am sure you'll have no objection to it .
i'll come to that . my proposal is
well , i admit i always do business on the safe side . could you let me have your proposal then ?
you certainly drive a hard bargain , mrs . brown .
well , if you put it this way , i'll have to comply . when shall we sign the contract , mrs . brown ?
how much do you pay wholesale for your products ?
that must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? after all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . how much do they go for retail ?
is that including tax ?
how much is your profit margin then ?
i have here our price sheet on a f . o . b . basis . the prices are given without engagement .
take your time .
i ’ m surprised to hear you say so . you know that the cost of pro duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
well , as i ’ ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
how much do you mean then ? can you give me a rough idea ?
impossible . how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
mrs . wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . i hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
the ball is in your court , mrs . wang . what price would you suggest ?
that won't do . you see , our profit margin is very narrow . it simply can't stand such a big cut .
well , i'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . would you mind waiting a day or two , until i get a reply from the home office ?
may i help you ?
what currency would you like to trade in ?
no problem , we can accept any denomination . how much would you like to exchange today ?
it's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . the american dollar is now worth 7 . 45rmb . if you would like to sell rib , we can give you a rate of 7 . 35 . will that be all right ?
so how did i do ?
i lost ?
so the price was good ?
so i didn't miss by much then .
i knew the delivery was slow but i figured the price would win it for me .
how much will our order from your factory be ?
i'm afraid i can't wait that long . can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ?
just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units .
your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit .
is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ?
based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short . with the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing . can ' t you do any better ?
i'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit . that is our bottom line . if you can meet that price , you've got the deal . otherwise .
you got our email with all the specifications for the project . we'll be accepting bids untill noon on tuesday . if you have any questions between now and then , please let me know .
i understand . but unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . you can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . we also consider other elements , including design and practicality . we also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company .
so how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
things are so great here . i almost smiled myself to death last week . one of my coworkers had to give me cpr .
or a curse .
that , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , i'll let you have'em at 50 off .
hello , come in , i've been waiting for you .
ha , ha , ha ! yes , i guess i deserved that . let me explain , okay ?
well , as you probably know i buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people .
i'm very old fashioned . i believe in loyalty . once i start a sales relationship with someone , i stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . i expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle . but if i find out they screwed me over , then i find another supplier .
well , those are my terms . as long as you honor them , we do business . if you break faith and try to take advantage , i'll find someone else to work with . can you live with that ?
sandrawu chunk international .
i can check that for you right now . would you mind holding ?
mr . robson , i'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ?
yes , i have it right here . i'm so sorry about this .
good morning , welcome to bank of the usa . how may i help you today ?
okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
it ’ s alright , i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
okay , i ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number .
well . you ’ ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today .
i ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , mr . johnson . i can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
well , as you know , i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon bons here in the united states . they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
actually , the factory is located in scotland .
that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one !
unique , aren ’ t they ? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i ’ m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis .
it ’ s a traditional scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .
but it would only be adding to the existing structure . we're not talking about anything new here .
how much do you think it would cost ?
can't you give me a break on this ? we've already spent so much money on lighting , i hate to have to blow so much more on halogens .
we agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . good news is , i talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance .
now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . that shouldn't be a problem , right ?
so , if all this is agreeable to you , i'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . if you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on tuesday .
i really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . i've thought through a lot of these details , and i hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon .
firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . if you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days .
well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees .
we cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % .
good afternoon miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? you know , you can never get enough .
are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? if something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .
could we sit and look at the policy i mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?
i don ’ t think i could afford that kind of car again . i think i ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace .
what will happen if i chose a smaller car ? would the payments be the same ?
excuse me may i know the name of your corporation ?
we found your samples very attractive . we ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable
can i have a reduction of seven percent ?
can i use the fas terms ?
do you think i should turn down his offer ?
but we may not get another partner .
what happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? how do i handle that ?
right ! so how do i do that ? what will make you happy ?
excuse me ?
what kind of change , just in prices ?
you mean on product availability , reliability and price ?
so it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . i can do that , provided the company i'm working for isn't hurt .
well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . now what about the terms of payment ?
to tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . when i open a letter of credit with a bank , i have to pay a deposit . that'll tie up my money and increase my cost .
still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d / a or d / p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you , but it does to me .
to meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by l / c and the balance by d / p ?
hi , bill . it's marsha black at mppd ltd . how are you ?
not too bad at all . do you have a minute ?
we're getting ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year . you know , so we can have the funds put aside .
right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to .
it's going to be shown to the board so i need it in writing . make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . how soon can i have it ?
yeah , i'm afraid so . i really need your help here .
mrs . miller , you are an old friend of ours . in order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . will that satisfy you ?
now i repeat , 5 , 000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each c . i . f . los angeles .
as to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton .
yes , corrugated cardboard boxes .
why use wooden cases ?
cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . they'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps .
please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . another thing , the l / c should be valid until the 15th day after shipment .
right . we'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by houston commodities inspection bureau , which is final and binding on both parties .
thank you . you can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . however , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions .
let me see . if we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature .
well , mr . brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ?
i know some of them are doing that . but this is new to me . i've never made payment in yen before . it is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but i may have some difficulty in making payment in yen .
do you mean to say that i can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in london or bonn ?
to get around your difficulty , mr . brown , i'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . you can send in an addi trional order later .
a month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .
getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space all this takes time , you know . you cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month .
when will that be ?
very good . well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . i sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .
well , this is something new . a few of our friends from europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . we think there are a lot of details to go into .
naturally , i appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of japanese arts and crafts . but i'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . i must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time .
hi , mr . brown , we have visited the factories and i'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions .
that's very good . but i have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . i just want to know the details about that .
sure .
oh , the packing looks very nice .
good , what about the export packing ?
is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? you see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . it's about 2 , 400 kilograms .
i'm glad to hear that . by the way , do you accept neutral packing ?
very good . ok , mr . brown , i'm now totally satisfied with your packing . you can execute our first order now , and i will open the l / c immediately after i return to taipei .
that price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1 , 000 saddles .
20 30 % . but we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . that is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery .
sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months .
all in the local market . one or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you .
perhaps . general opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra .
i wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem .
the federal food and drug administration , or the fda as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the united states . over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head ache for us importers .
ah , there's something in what you're saying . according to the present fda regulations , the ma ling labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the united states .
i'd be quite willing to if i could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the customs .
would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a c . i . f . basis for delivery in hong kong ? our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the fda regulations .
mr . jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ?
good . a wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . with competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive .
what about the outer packing ?
cartons ?
could you use wooden cases instead ?
i'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load .
maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at hamburg or london . if the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . this would make the blouses spotted or ruined .
maybe so , but i'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage .
if you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons .
i can understand your position . perhaps i'm asking too much .
well , i'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter .
now we have settled the terms of payment . is it possible to effect shipment during september ?
that's too late . you see , november is the season for this commodity in our market , and our customs formalities are rather complicated .
besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . the goods must therefore be shipped before october ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season .
mr . brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . if we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out .
that's too bad , but i sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration .
but can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? make a special effort , please . a timely delivery means a lot to us .
well , that was an interesting documentary !
like what ?
yeah , i know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg .
that seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ?
it has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods .
how about making hong kong the port of shipment instead of new york ?
it's like this . there are only one or two ships sailing a month from new york to osaka , while sailings from hong kong are quite frequent . if shipment were effected from hong kong , we could receive the goods much earlier .
it sounds all right to me , but i will have to think about it . i'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . if i choose seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of march ?
hello , sir , may i help you ?
very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !
that is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
good morning . i ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies .
i bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .
i understand . i live in the oakfield area and paid $ 100 , 000 for my home .
oh , i see . that ’ s fine . what is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?
it seems that i should do some calculations before deciding . i presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .
if i have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? i ’ ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .
i want to open a saving account , sir . what's the proper procedure ?
is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
what is the annual interest rate ?
by the way , can i open a checking account too ?
next , please . may i help you , sir ?
certainly , i can can help you with that . what type of account would you like to open ? a chequing or a savings account ?
well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10 , 000 dollars .
alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . will you require overdraft protection ? there is an extra fee for that .
in that case , i ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . i ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government id . if you could just sign here , and here , and here we ’ ll be all set . would you like to make a deposit today ?
well , in that case , i think a checking account may be more convenient for you . however , there's a service charge .
one percent .
more than enough . please fill in this form .
may i help you ?
please fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw .
your id card , please .
do you want large ones or small ones ?
wait a minute , please . here's the cash .
well , sir . according to today's exchange rate , every pound in cash is equivalent to 1 . 89 u . s . dollars . how much would you like to change ?
. ok . and here's your money .
hello , i'd like to open an account .
i'd like to open a savings account . what's the interest rate now ?
is there any minimum deposit for the first time ?
what about the later deposits ?
ok , that's good .
good coming , sir . what can i do for you ?
very good , sir . what kind would you like ?
besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account .
would you fill out this form ?
all right . and here's your deposit book .
may i help you ?
do you have an account with us ?
do you want large or small bills ?
what denomination ?
do you want the whole amount in traveler's check ?
may i help you ?
of course , we'd be happy to cash it for you .
well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . we cash it at present traveler's check buying rate .
the service charge is 1 % of the total amount of the check .
would you please countersign them here ?
and your passport please .
can i help you , sir ?
one thousand u . s . mm hmm . and are you going to pay cash ?
all right . now can i have your passbook ?
thank you . and what amounts do you want the checks in ?
i want to open a saving account , sir . what ' s the proper procedure ?
is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
what is the annual interest rate ?
by the way , can i open a checking account too ?
good morning , sir . how may i help you ?
certainly , sir . would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account ?
can i help you ?
let me see , the buying rate is rib 808 per $ 100 . how much would you like to change ?
would you mind showing me your passport ?
let me see . $ 200 makes rib 1 , 616 . here is the cash and exchange memo . please check it .
okay , i want to change 22 , 000 .
okay , here you are . ( she hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . )
is this the foreign exchange department ?
i need some us dollars .
rib . by the way , what is the exchange rate today ?
and i want to change 4000 yuan .
good afternoon , mr . chen . how are you ?
how much do you want , mr . chen ?
certainly , sir . how do you want it ?
yes , mr . chen . here you are .
excuse me . i'd like to cash the traveler's check .
in tens and fifties , please .
hello , madam . would you like to take a look at our products ? they are high tech items .
sure . do you have a minute ? why don't you have a seat and let me show you how to operate this item ?
it only costs you 20 dollars for one .
we're going to discuss how to market cb series soon . does your project go well ?
oh , that's good .
which service offered by your bank do you use most ?
do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? they are much safer than carrying lots of cash around .
do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? i use direct debit .
that ’ s good idea . you don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . i suppose you have a mortgage too .
hello . can i help you , ma'am ?
it depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . a swift transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . how much do you wanna send ?
about a week .
sure . you can have a telegraphic or a swift transfer .
both a telegraphic transfer and a swift transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank .
oh yes . i've got it written down here . just a minute .
i can just enter the amount using the keys , right ?
hi . may i help you ?
1 . 15 u . s . dollars to the euro .
sure . how much would you like to change ?
very good . may i see your passport ?
how would you like your bills ?
hey , son , are you insured ?
i took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
i am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . i have to consider your mother's life .
you have children now . what if something , god forbid , happens to you ?
good morning . how can i help you ?
have you filled out an application form ?
yes . actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in atm machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction .
it is . our customers really like it . do you have any other questions about your new accounts ?
the maximum is $ 1000 .
yes , but it's not much . you just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . it's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards .
they're all in order . if you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks .
hello , can i speak to mr . green ?
this is steven speaking . i'd like to buy a stock .
i'd like to buy 1 000 shares of duson .
let me see . the offering price is near or at $ 88 .
do you mean that i have to buy it at current price ?
i heard that this stock would go up . hum , i will take it at current price .
good afternoon , madam . can i help you ?
ok . how do you like your money , madam ?
savings , please .
is there any service charge ?
400 us dollars . here it is . would you please give me small bills ?
miss green , do you have life insurance right now ?
this year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . i think you might be interested .
may i help you ?
sure . please sign your name here . and here .
thanks . how would you like them ?
good morning , madam .
may i help you ?
this way , please .
the nasdaq gained a few points today .
it's hard to say . the stock market is weird . you never know what will happen tomorrow .

i have my passport with me , a driver ’ s license and a membership card . will they do ?

i'd like to have this cashed , please .
yes .
ten hundreds and ten twenties , and the rest in small change , please .
excuse me , sir . is there anything i can do for you ?
all right . how much would you like to change ?
pardon ?
ok . here .

certainly . here you are . our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . i have to remind you that our terms are cif hamburg . i hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us .
man , they take a lot of our paycheck .
seriously . the only tax i don ’ t mind them taking is social security . it ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck .
yeah . it won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old .

good morning , welcome to bank of the usa . how may i help you today ?
okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?
it ’ s alright , i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ?
okay , i ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number .
well . you ’ ve come prepared . you have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today .
hello , sir , may i help you ?
very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans .
it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment !
that is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .
i know where to put my card ! stupid machine , talking to me like i ’ m an idiot .
no , no ! stupid machine , what are you doing ! no !
that ’ s a little steep for our company . do you offer any discounts ?

what separates your product from the competition ?
is the software user friendly ?
is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ?
what are your terms of payment ?
what if we purchase an increased quantity ? can you give us better terms ?
we do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5 , 000 units .
is this the law firm of a & b ?
i need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance .
is she available ?
i ’ m so frustrated !
i called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what i wanted !
yes . they have some sort of digital receptionist . so when i called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department i wanted to be transferred to .
i just kept pushing buttons . i was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information .
it seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills .
and if we take the decker units you suggested , what would the price be ?
isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ?
that's too much . we need to use the separate units , i guess .
you mean installation isn't included ? i'm very surprised .
in taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell . they don't charge extra .
yes , i suppose i should get used to it . but i'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this . we haven't even opened yet .
and the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars .
i will tell you what i can agree to . if you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , i can accept .
you do seem like a better company than the other one . so i am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . but i won't pay more than 6000 .
i ’ d like to open a savings account . can you tell me how to do it ?
what ‘ s the minimum amount i can deposit in an account ?
you won't believe what just happened .
i went down to change some money , right ?
i wanted to change around 5000 dollars . and you know the exchange rate .
not today .
i went into the bank with my money , and i looked at the exchange board . at first i couldn't believe it . i thought i was reading the board wrong or something .
because the board said 60 pesos for every taiwan dollar .
i thought it was wrong too . it didn't make sense .
so , i went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . and it's true . they really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar .
i ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account .
sure ?
welcome to the company . we are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
you're kidding ! something as simple as that ?
yes , there has been a lot of research into rsi's . something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
have you had a chance to look over the contract ?
and do you have any questions ?
no , probably not . for the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours .
i understand . that's why i didn't write the date on the contract . for the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach . when you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect . is that alright with you ?
i don't want you to misunderstand , miss briggs . we are very serious about hiring you . we want you to teach for us . we usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient .
good . and your benefits will begin immediately .
yes . we will apply for your health insurance tomorrow . and your free membership in the club starts today if you like .
what would you like to know ?
absolutely . the only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers .
paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers . the vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge . but we don't offer vouchers to employees .
that's right . so in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members . you get more benefits than they do .
yes . i've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything . so that you understand the terms .
i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ?
well , you do still have three weeks . but remember the employee must sign them , too . filling them in is nothing it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time .
so it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ?
i suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . then , based on their self assessment , you can add your comments . it's a great starting point for discussion
i ’ d like to have this cashed , please .
yes .
ten hundreds and ten twenties and the rest of small changes please .

can you tell me , ms . smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
what ’ s the result ?
that seems very impressive . good work !
i ’ d like to open a current account .
here your are . i wonder how much interest can i earn for my current account .
why is that ?
well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment .
sure ! it's not a real figure , of course . it's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence .
a little of both . we'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . those are available to everyone . we also have a variety of other programs
i wish the same . as such , i hope you will seriously consider a pay increase .
so , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ?
salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these other people make ?
i see your point . however , it might be hard to get a raise approved . profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget
as you know i ’ ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . i am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump start my future .
thank you . i ’ ve really enjoyed my time here . i've grown both personally and professionally with this company .

we bought 1 , 000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
here is the survey report from a well known public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . you should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
good morning . how can i help you ?
have you filled out an application form ?
yes . i'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ?
