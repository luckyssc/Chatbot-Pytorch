as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?

hey , jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the tv all day . anything interesting on tv ?

i see . that sounds fine . until what time are you open ?
i agree , but i like wire frames .
excuse me , i'm looking for your casual short sleeved shirts . can you tell me where those are ?
why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? i'm sure they'd look fabulous on you .
sounds good .

why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ?
ok , and what about the main course ? which would you rather have , fish or meat ?
fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ?
thank you .

it was in my pocket , but now i can't find it .

last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . we can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! it ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt !

i thought i could just get you and dad to pay for an apartment . i found a cheap one .
thank you . could you tell me the specials today ?
here you go , and here ’ s your receipt . have a nice day .
manicole tan .
no problem . first , it's comfortable and cozy . second , it has a lovely view of the city . third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .
it certainly is . but to tell you the truth , the room is so large that i can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .
cool , thanks .
don ’ t you have air conditioning in your apartment ? it ’ s sweltering here !
well , i think we could be saving more .
we'd like a non smoking table , please .
hello , can i help you ?

thanks , i didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . are you ok ?
well , not every chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from sichuan and cuizhou provinces can . back where i come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .

ok , i know where this is going . how much will it cost me to get a new computer ?
right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . i suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . that way you can play games online without any lag . this package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free !
really ? what ’ s the catch ?
that ’ s great ! i ’ m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
on the contrary , i have been reading a lot of books about the subject .
well , first i need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools .
i ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . i ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! gardening all done !
but i'm quite careful when i'm browsing the internet , i have no idea how i could have picked a virus .
ok . anything else ?
even in the winter ?
i think my arm is broken .
it doesn't work . it looks like it's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
i see . do the machines have soap in them ?

that sounds good . do i need to bring anything ?
how ’ s it going ?
yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
how are you doing ?
what ’ s the problem ?
did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ?
will the utilities be turned on ?
yes , we do . we also eat a lot of lamb .
they can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it .
part of the motor is loose . i can put it back in place quite easily .
ok , i ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . i ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . i always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . wow , you can chop vegetables really quickly

do you like cooking , julia ?
how often do you usually cook ?
i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you !

where do i put the money in ?

well , give me the walkman . i'll listen to the music then .
how about the new bar across the road ?
but it explains why taylor isn't answering and femi took time off from work .
well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he !
why are you feeling depressed ?
why not ?
would you like me to give you a lift ?
it shouldn't be a problem .
you seem to have all the jitters about jane .
yuck . the carrots taste awful and salty . hi sis , how do you like them ?
well , you can have all my carrots .
i don't know what i can do now . i'm down and out .
yes , i want to go out . would you like to come ?
you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion . sometimes i don't know what the meaning of working is ?
that sounds interesting . but i don't know how to do that .
i am afraid so . i am terribly sorry !
hi , elvin . how are the new programmers i got for you ?
elvin , please . can i count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ?
1808 . the toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower .
how could you ? i reminded you just this morning .
david , why didn ’ t you clean the room ?
then forgive her mistake .
what a charming room ! it faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city .
i was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ?
my mother in law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
come in , come in !
it ’ s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy .
isn't it awful ? i can't bear to look at it . i don't think i can stand this place for two weeks .
yeah , that ’ s what i told her . i ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own .
really ? did coke pay him for that ?
yes . they ’ re coming the beginning of august .
remember the garden party they gave when we were in england ?
leo , i really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . i know he used to be your best friend in college , but i really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .
would you please put that cigarette out ? i get sick on it .
now , don ’ t go losing your temper . if you tolerated all you can , just kick him out . but do it with gloves . i know ! tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated !
yes . but those are the rush in that moment . and my boss ask me to do some urgent letters .
i ’ ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there .
many congratulations on your winning the game .
and not expensive either .
actually , i'm calling to complain about your service . the computer i bought last week is faulty .
you know you didn't .
thank you very much , mr . parker . but , that is my job .
it's really frustrating , isn't it ? i have the same problem . i would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . with the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke .
you dance beautifully too .
will you give me your camera ? we have to confiscate your film .
did you go to the bank to withdraw money ?
yeah , right . but what did you put on your face last night ? those little greenish things .
really ? it took me really a while to find the color . i am happy you like it .
perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type .
how could you manage to pass the exam ?
what's that ?
i do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift !
yeah . it ’ s a lot better than mine .
it's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all .
i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening . she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on friday , but i really can't decide what to do .
rock music really leaves me cold . what about you ?
that ’ s true . for the junior executive room . three nights . yes , your bill should be $ 1 , 500
why ? what happened ?
they're incredibly selfish . they ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
your brand new car is so excellent . i like it very much .
it ’ s dangerous . i don ’ t dare to go .
she's my cousin .
not that well . i've got that monday morning feeling today .
why don't you get it all fixed ?
so , how should we go to the theatre ?
i can fix those for you . is there anything else wrong with it ?
it was good . i brough lunch from home today .
today is saturday .
hi , lander . what's wrong ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense .
no . can i have my money back ?
it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it !
yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .
doris , i'm glad you're home . i'm terrified . i don't know what to do !
geez . is that all ?
that ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ ve had ! let ’ s do it !
20 to 1 , in favour of the cougars !
he followed me all the way home !
oh , my god ! i've been cheated !
yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look , it even had a bar code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .
and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states ?
i hate working on christmas eve ! whoa ! get a load of this guy ! come in central , i think we ’ ve got ourselves a situation here .
can i help you , sir ?
yes . you must fill up the car yourself .
you must have realized somebody was here .
i've just been a little depressed lately .
how did you know ?
what's your favorite magazine ?
really ? it is a weekly , isn't it ?
how have you been ?
well , it was nice meeting you .
do you have any where in mind ?
i'm terribly nervous .
have you ever seen coco ?
so you can learn a lot from him .
i'm catching the 11:00 train .
fine , thanks . i've been busy lately .
i can't . i have to meet someone .
okay , let's both look for it now .
i'm doing great , thank you .
nice day today , isn't it ?
are you going to be okay ?
why don't you go out with jack ?
yeah , that would let us know what would work best .
mary and i will be driving the van .
you're spending a very long time on my hair .
we're thinking about going to america .
broadway mall is having a big sale this weekend . you wanna go ?
that sounds absolutely disgusting !
i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ?
yes , it might be worth it . i am not certain .
i agree with that , it just doesn't work for me .
make it a few inches long .
i want my hair to be only a few inches long .
don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . that , that makes it worse .
i'm so angry at bob for buying a new bike .
so , can i buy some new shoes as a christmas present ?
do you have spare time tonight ?
absolutely .
i don't dare ask jane for a date .
of course .
what kind of music do you like best ?
let me enjoy it .
may i invite you for the first dance ?
i'm very glad to meet you . may i have this dance with you ?
would you mind if i smoked ?
you mean it is a still virtual game . your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ?
yes . we'll have our baby soon .
did you have a good holiday ?
can you recommend a resort to me ?
do you have change for a hundred ?
you won't play online games full of violence , will you ?
how was the party ?
have a nice weekend .
how do you like korea ?
where are you from ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
for me , the olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . it makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible .
i guess it ’ s formal .
those young actors play the roles perfectly .
no . not really .
dad , where are we off to ?
would you like to come over for dinner tonight ?
yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities .
i haven't read a book like that for as long as i can remember .
yes ! somebody up there loves me ! i knew it wasn't too late for snow .
oh , yes . it is a fantastic city . and i like german food as well .
i think he had water on the brain . this is bad .
did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
you think she's out of my league ?
it's a very popular game in america .
let's do something really nice for our family this christmas .
i heard them warming up earlier . you're right .
does five thirty work for you ?
hey , i'll go with you .
actual 1y , it was their idea first .
sterlet . it's spelt 0 , s , t , e , r , l , e , y .
the bright people will remember it forever .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she didn't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
does she have a boyfriend ?
how about coffee down the street ?
this is your first christmas in the us . here is the gift for you .
someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the management position i wanted .

ok . fifty yuan for each .
my brother has offered me two tickets for this evening .
good idea . let's goa
what do you do in your spare time ?
let me try . oh , i missed !
for killing time and making new friends .
calm down ! my little guy ! you'll get used to that after you come here several times .
( the waiter makes the cocktail for mr . bellow and hands into him . ) here is your shanghai cocktail , mr . bellow .
who has a crush ? !
this is tough to say , john , but i think we should break up .
really ! did she tell you why she didn't show up ?
what was she thinking ? did you confront her about it when you saw her ?
what's up , buddy ? you look so upset .
mary , how was your date with john ?
oh , ok . that's a nice name , nandu . and where are you from ?

what do you like to do in your spare time ?
i'd like to , but i have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . how about tomorrow ?

vodka martini ?
it is so quiet here . i like the place .
sorry , we have student cards . we can get discounts with these , can't we ?
how do you spend your spare time ?
you'll get used to it . after everything stabilizes , you can regain your health .

why is that ?
what kind of things do you paint ?
i forgot my cigarette today . do you have another one ?
jason , where have you been hiding lately ? you know it's been a long time since your last call . have you been good ?
that's good . so i guess i'll have to make an appointment to see you .
that is the most beautiful sunset !
you gotta give it a chance . it's fun after awhile .
well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . he lives alone , you know .
here ’ s your hot dog and beer . what happened ? did i miss anything ?

i feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
how about the new bar across road ?
that's a long time .
please go ahead , i am listening .
cool . thanks . ( jimmy brings may a glass of orange juice . )
i feel they all talk and behave in a different way .
some even do make up slightly . are you aware that previous ' small potato ' ma xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ?
where should we meet ?
why don't you like horror ? they're entertaining .
what are you doing ?
so beth , what kind of music do you listen to ?
was it love at first sight ? did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ?
hey joanne . what are you up to ?
i don't think we are boring . it's just that we don't have any hobbies .

how awful , poor guy .

henry , i want to ask you something .
but i prefer warm weather .
oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?
don't worry . i'm sure you'll do better next time .
but sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth .

i believe it . hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .
which university did you graduate from ?
they are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand .

we will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . and if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station .
i hate landing in the sand trap ! now i'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out .
happy new year !
where are you going ?
how are you , sam ?
so you have to work all day .
hey ! i have a surprise for you .
oh , i have an elder sister . she is married her husband is a businessman .
i'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses .
good . i think i'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror !
why not ? they are very fun and exiting .
does your husband feel the same ?
you did a good job . but i got tired of working in the garden .
really ? i like rainy days . the moisture in the air is good for my skin .
how do you celebrate thanksgiving in the us ?
it's 7500 yuan per square meter , and i really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . its total area is about 80 square meters .
you have made a poor meal . let me get you some more fish .
can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ?
for god's sake ! it's too bloody . how can people be so cruel ?
my boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . can you guess why ?
that is exactly what the poll shows . although the stating of clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent .
the restaurant across the street hired a new chinese chef , so i ordered some chinese food there for this evening .
if so , we may live there someday .
stop talking like my mother . that's what she keeps saying .
what are you using for bait today ?
mary said she couldn't put up with tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
let's go buy their new album . want to come with me ?
which team do you back then ?
the tallest one .
i'm sorry to hear that . well , i heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women .
no . i'm sure i know her .
have you heard that new song by the beastie boys ?
have you heard maria carey ?
hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ?
how about that european movie ?
yes . and what dances do you do best ?
it's rather cold , isn't it ?
looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . to pull the t shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it .
how about sunday , then ? we could start in the morning .
i asked santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games .
i thought everyone in your country were experts at mah jong !
oh , the day after tomorrow is christmas .
tell me all about it .
i know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . after all , it's a sport . but do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ?
i want to do everything i can .
position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can .
so , is l . a . all it's cracked up to be ?
i hear that you've been to the saikei ski resort for the weekend . did you enjoy it ?
i want to apologize . is there anything can do for you ?
i know little of her . i only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . of course , she ’ s diligent , too .
i know you have a son . how old is he ?
when ?
why don't you get it all fixed ?
thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in china .
do you believe her excuse ?
bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?
may i invite you to dance with me ?
did you say that ted was at your mercy ?
i think so , since i was in primary school . how long have you been interested in classical music .
hello .
john .
would 7:00 be ok ?
i'm hungry . i'd like to eat something .
why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ?
how about bill's seafood restaurant ?
really ! what's the matter with him ?
well , tell him to take it easy and that i hope he feels better .
nice to meet you too .
the italian restaurant on 5th street .
what's the weather today ?
what was the weather like yesterday ?
what day is today ? tuesday ?
you speak really well .
have you ever been to las vegas ?
i will go to japan on business for 5 days next tuesday . i want to exchange some japanese yen .
just take it easy . come on with me .
i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution .
we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced .
you are right . let ’ s stop idling around and do something .
you know , smoking does do harm to your health .
have you ever thought of just cutting down ? you could do it gradually .
that's too bad .
i don't think so . let's walk by the stream . i am sure we can find the waterfall on the map .
are you serious , john ?
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yup .
really ? come on , i'll introduce them to you .
how come you're still up ? shouldn't you be asleep by now ?
you are invited to my wedding .
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you'll change your mind .
would you like another beer ?
where were you ?
come and sit down . would you like a drink ?
hi ! susan ! i haven't seen you for ages !
i plan to buy a car this year .
how about a party at home ? that way we can get together and celebrate it .
hello , zhang lin ! fancy meeting you here !
it can't be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you .
i feel he is as cold as charity to me .
hello , jack ! fancy meeting you here !
i don't know about you , but i am famished . are you interested in getting a bite to eat ?
what does your mother do , may i ask ?
julia , are you free tonight ?
it's almost time to get aboard .
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ?
i'm not really in the mood for italian , actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy .
i really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . but , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .
how come ?
you're really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down .
it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ?
i didn't know you liked bird watching .
what is that below ?
no . thank you . it looks a bit too dangerous for me .
i can ’ t believe she would do that to you . it ’ s so dishonest and rude !
what are you doing tonight ?
your tie is handsome .
that's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian .
that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . there ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . i ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing i can do about that . my boss won ’ t believe me if i tell him the truth .
good morning !
hello . can i sit here ?
is there any clue ?
would you like to go to a concert tonight ?
he's tall and strong .
have you heard we'll have a pay rise ?
it's a feature film .
i sure am . so what about you ? how did you feel when you graduated ?
you don't like the performance , do you ?
i think it was about 45 minutes long .
i hate to go outside .
rude people are everywhere .
does she know how to speak spanish ?
do you like jazz , tom ?
why ? you seem pretty sure about it .
and when did you come to los angeles ?
not bad . you know i'm an air traffic controller now .
i like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night .
yeah . this is a clever way to be in contact with such a person .
yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .
then he become angry with you ?
today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them .
how about joining our summer camp next week ?
yeah , child is the matter . don't tell jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . when she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her .
how is he ?
i hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ?
yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people .
good afternoon !
where do you live ?
john , my father isn't there at all . are you kidding ?
do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ?
it's very expensive , right ?
sure . you can send e mail to each other every day through the internet . in addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too .
can you speak any other languages ?
that's pretty harsh .
at least more than 100 years old .
it's lin . it's spelled l i n .
yesterday i met mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary .
isn't it wonderful walking here ?
what else did you see ?
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ?
so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ?
it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ?
yes that might be a better idea .
would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ?
we used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship .
are you feeling better today , bill ?
it's got to be almost a year now .
why are you walking to and fro in the room ?
it's sounds like fun .
so you haven ’ t done much then , in shanghai ?
why are you asking me about my boyfriend ?
do you want to borrow my coat ? i have a black coat that would look smashing on you .
why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ?
so do you think you can get to the office alone ?
how ’ s your father ?
my name is dick brown .
no , i haven ’ t got any plans .
not much , just a house party with some friends .
me too , but i think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy .
so you're traveling around the world , aren't you .
did you have a good journey ?
what kind of music do you like ?
no , he doesn ’ t . anyway , she found out that he had been two timing her for a long time .
have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ?
good for you ! it sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
i have thought about it for a while . i think it ’ s time to move on for both of us .
you look pale , you must have poor health .
you look pale recently .
is that true ?
maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much !
what is your current occupation ?
do you like your current job ?
why did you lie to me in the email ?
you shouldn't take it too seriously . it might be a lie .
really ? is he married ?
oh , i see . office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
office romance is very tricky .
it seldom rains this summer .
come on , dear . i know you mustn ’ t forget it .
really ? i ’ m surprised .
i just had a terrible week .
i have been looking forward to this performance all month .
such friends are even worse than enemies .
last weekend , while they were on their ski trip .
lisa , i am told you did very well in your exam .
really , it was nothing .
does 6 , 30 suit you ?
hi , how are you doing ?
do you love me ? come on , i ’ m eager to hear .
don't worry . i think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together .
why not ?
i ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture .
you'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . he may probably give you the bag .
i haven ’ t met bob for years . how is he ?
and listen to this ! what do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ?
yes , if that's all right for you .
no , i just started working here at ibm , i am in the sale department .
i've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch . but it was heading toward my friend's house . so i quickly called them on the phone .
no , it didn't . but they are glad i called them .
i think my arm is broken .
my birthday ? i forgot it , thank you for remembering my birthday .
sure , i'll get it for you . books or magazines ?
yes . you look very smart today .
is this zhang lin's home ?
can i hold it for a moment ?
that ’ s very kind of you . but if i don ’ t go now i ’ ll miss the last bus .
i want to say goodbye . i ’ m leaving for america tomorrow .
and how about kyoto ?
yes , it's only eight forty . thanks so much !
certainly . mr . lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library .
billy , you are late again .
i think he might . you'd better go to his office .
you'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ?
hi , alice , what are you doing this sunday .
who do you mean ?
i don ’ t know why i married him .
what did you say when she told you the news ?
the trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
she said she would name it after her father .
but the word is his brother would go bail for him . last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him .
you mean tony is the victim ? no , i don ’ t think so . he ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
the last thing i want to see is to lose face before my friends .
my mother and my wife are always holding different ideas .
do you think i should ask bob to help ? will he come ?
uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . only once .
i ’ ll be away for a moment .
i ’ ve ever seen a living being looked so thin .
i hear you and james are engaged at last .
did you bring some lunch with you ?
i never thought about it that way .
you honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ?
sorry , here .
oh , yeah ?
well , tell me . what are they like ?
and now ?
how ’ re you today ?
how long do you have to be there ?
why do you say that ?
bill , how can you hear so happy today ?
have you got your invitation yet ?
oh no .
i'm glad you're so happy .
tomorrow ? no , i am afraid i won ’ t be able to . i ’ m going on business to birmingham .
this dish is really delicious .
yes , this coming saturday .
oh , i learned that he is also a legendary violinist .
you mean used car ?
hi , mary , it ’ s been a long time .
why ?
what's the weather like in your country ?
no , i'm not hungry .
good ! i'm interested in your advice .
so you should bring an umbrella often .
do you mean you got a divorce ?
are you a smoker ?
i just dropped in to say good bye .
i'm going to try to leave by ten .
health monitor ? i read an article about that racket . they ' re overpriced to begin with ! listen , if i were you , i'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical .
no joke !
fine , only a little tired .
sure it was .
that's right .
jenny , are you having fun here ?
how about a movie tonight ?
you look so happy , anna . any good news ?
i couldn't even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home , then i'd have to find my own place .
so chris , i've heard that you're from a big family . how many people ?
oh , yes . i like to exercise . but i don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . i don ’ t have much time to do those things .
i must confess i have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch .
what kind of house is it ?
ok , ok . i'll ask my sister to come . that way we'll have fourteen for dinner .
i think modern painting means nothing .
you want to bet ?
he ’ s going to be sent to britain to study , really ?
nice to see you , patrick .
are you all right ?
well , i hope you ’ ll feel better soon .
john , i ’ d like you to meet charles brown , our new manager at the airport .
my mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day . my mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps . my father is very much completely opposite that . he is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , i think in real life , and she is very nice .
well , i really like being with her .
and how about your spanish ?
i often feel so tired .
but you should make up your mind first .
why don't you go to bed and get up early ? you'll have the same time for work .
i don't think so . your admirer seems kind of sweet . aren't you even a little curious about him ?
the only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is zina .
oh , ok .
i know a place that should be perfect . it's called the china friendship shopping center and it's pretty much like an american mall except with more variety . you can even buy a live chicken there if you want .
that's right . and i'm going to be vice president of marketing .
i feel sorry for her .
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
are you a smoker ?
oh , i ’ m sorry . but this isn ’ t a no smoker , isn ’ t it ? i mean would you mind if i smoke here ?
sign ? what ’ s sign ?
very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .
when are you getting married ?
do you get much rain during the summer ?
it's raining outside , catherine , it's too bad . what ' s the weather like in your hometown ?
what about the weather in boston ?
no , i'm not hungry .
how do you usually spend your leisure time ? i mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ?
i heard that you went to the concert the day before ? how did you like it ?
why ?
look ! it looks as if it is going to rain .
says who ?
today .
why ?
of course not . i just thought the movie was . boring .
it is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it .
both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values .
jack wonders whether linda likes him or not .
really ? he is my type .
hello , is it necessary to do warm up exercise ? i can't wait to dive into the water .
ok . look , i've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out .
ah , got it . ideal life school , programs
but i never saw them .
really ?
yeah . you look so unhappy recently . what ’ s the matter .
are you sure ?
how much do you make ?
a friend of mine is now in the big house . he was caught red handed for selling cocaine .
why not go to see the doctor ?
so you are watching your weight , aren't you ?
let me introduce myself , by the way . my name's thomas bradley .
ok , i'm tom .
how about sunday then ?
i don't know what time it is .
really ? that ’ s very good of you , helen . but i must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing .
i expected that something might get broken . that doesn ’ t bother me . that spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ?
there are no countries marked on the map .
both our countries are quite small . how would you describe the landscape in your country ?
is it really completely flat ?
they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another .
that ’ s right . that ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species .
good morning . i ’ m from the new york book review . could i ask you some questions about your latest book ?
that ’ s too bad . how long was the flight ?
is there any pain now ?
who ’ s your favourite player ?
i can ’ t keep up with the game . the players play so quickly that i can hardly see what they are doing .
you play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ?
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight . how about you ?
are you a member of his fan club ?
i bet they love it really . sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ?
that ’ s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit .
so , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
what do you think are the main causes of war today ?
i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes .
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ?
how do you think people get their personalities ?
what time are you leaving ?
well , we could go to a movie . have you see shrek 2 ?
i usually only drink beer and i rarely drink more than a few pints .
i see . well , we have a lot of spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any spanish here .
i don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! that's just the problem . in these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first .
dalian is a beautiful city . do you agree ?
that's what my parents want me to do .
hm , what you say makes sense . but you know , i still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and i hate to do so at this age .
hi , mr . james , what ’ s the rush ?
there ’ s a possibility . what do you say ?
yes . only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it .
i can't open the door .
oh , that's too bad ! i am sorry to hear that !
not at all .
nice to meet you . and what do you do , susan ?
what's that book you have under your arm ?
yes , but they are used for other things , too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris .
good morning mike !
what ? really ? i don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone .
thank you .
who's that ?
i just meant that she's got different taste .
really ? wow with who ?
they played ball at school . here we go . yi jun , go out for a pass !
hey , guys ! did you see that sign ?
i can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard i try and i have been here for 2 years already !
okay , this sounds a little tough , how am i supposed to practice for this ?
oh , i didn ’ t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something .
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man .
sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me .
let ’ s not go there , joanne ! ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , i ’ ll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back .
one last thing , i ’ ve decided to come out of the closet .
are you ok ? you seem a bit anxious .
have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ?
what ’ s the point ? we always make a new year ’ s resolution and by february we will have forgotten about it . it ’ s pointless .
really ? how do you know it was santa ?
well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
hey michelle , jump in quick . it's pouring out there !
honey , i ’ ll be right back !
i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally .
yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . i try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off .
i can ’ t , tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i ’ m only doing this for you . i don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do .
did you go to the roller rink on saturday ? i heard it was far out , man !
sure thing . so , where are you flying in from ?
things doing great ! it ’ s funny running into you like this . smell well , just last week i ran into matt as well .
exactly ! i ’ m going to cut out all that junk i eat , no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food .
has the game started yet ?
did you see that ? he traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it !
come on , dad , i need thirty thousand . i wanna get into the market . you know , i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . i look at this as an opportunity . this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
i love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice .
if you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
hi rose , what are you busy with right now ?
what kind of music do you like listening to ?
hello ! what are you reading about in the newspaper ?
thank you .
that would be great ! actually , can i get your phone number , ella ? that ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if i call you sometime .
it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly .
there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ?
i guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable .
no , i don ’ t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm .
how long will it take us to drive to london ?
how are the children doing at sport ?
no , i really must go now . my family are expecting me home soon .
ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon .
what do people usually do on saint valentine's day ?
fine , i know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . shall we try that one ?
no , you are just on time . we haven ’ t really started yet .
would you like some coffee , tom ?
here's some sugar .
do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows ?
i'm told cold blood just finished its last cut .
gone with the wind .
i don't think much of the film .
i prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for ice cream .
that ’ s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather .
can we go to the beach on foot ?
japanese is easy to learn .
actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision .
you know , just giving me lots to do . i'm really busy right now .
after baseball practice .
i'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ?
are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ?
do you need a hand with that ?
you are friend of janet , right ? i am andrew , andrew smith .
what's the temperature today anyway ?
when do you go to bed usually ?
well , these days too many people are getting divorced . if they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .
would you recommend some places for sightseeing ?
two , a boy and a girl . they ’ re already grown now .
management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , i'd guess . i don't blame them . labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives .
where's bill ? the ambassador is already here . the meeting is set to start at 9 am .
how are your work now ?
did you tip the bellboy ?
well , last night i went out with some journalists for a casual party , but i was overdressed . i wore what i consider casual an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels . you know .
you ’ re right . i am sorry . let ’ s go and watch the movie .
i asked if you come here often .
i can see that . but i didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work .
well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? it ’ s difficult , but very rewarding .
i ’ m not a christian . i just want to know why americans believe that sort of thing .
hi ! tom . fancy seeing you here it's a nice party isn't it ?
she had to go to the hospital .
yeah , but that's what she did .
what do you think of the play showed last night ?
i wonder if we can change to channel 26 .
oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs .
there was a concert country music last week .
it will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends . what kind of movie do you like best ?
i heard many stories about your brother .
from his looks , i'd say he's a man of character .
where do you plan to go this winter ?
he's handsome .
the acting of this film is marvelous . in spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the academy award of this year .
it is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them .
ella , it's been such a long week . i'm ready to go out and party . hey , let's go out for a night on the town .
the company's performance has improved since wallace became president . he's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . products are selling like hotcakes .
let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . i hope we are over our financial difficulties for good .
we're in big trouble , jason . nick is beating us by a long shot .
whew ! i'm impressed ! you really know your stuff !
when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know .
too . your face is really oily . perfect !
we ’ ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running .
have you noticed the mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ?
but mine could be a lie for his job .
you've heard of bruce jenner , haven't you ?
i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
which season do you like best ?
i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ?
how did that happen ?
would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
would you like to go skiing with me ? i heard the new ski area is great . they have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . i think it suits you best .
but these people say nothing about that . they are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days .
how's your current job going ?
tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think i should be wearing ?
you guessed right . besides , the color violet is a little girly for me .
no problem . see you !
are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ?
i heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger .
how would you describe your relationship with our boss ?
hi , jack . long time no see !
and do you have friend there ?
who ’ s that ?
i hope it won ’ t be too hot , i can ’ t stand the heat
it ’ s rather cold . isn ’ t it
shall i light the stove ?
there ’ s a lot of rain in summer . but it seldom rains in autumn
no . i ’ m from the north . i was born in beijing actually .
please excuse me , but i really have to be going .
how about the new bar across road ?
my colleagues quickly get promotions , while i always get sidelined . i don't know what to do anymore .
no , not really .
no , but i am sure it won't take more than an hour .
what does your father do ?
what about your mother ?
yes , i think so .
excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ?
thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ?
yes , i think i can help you . why not you come around and see me ? do you know my office ?
it is hard to say . but i've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant . sometimes , i am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
who has a crush ?
it's nice to see you again . have you changed jobs ?
how about a coffee in that cafe ?
that's it . she likes dogs so much now , and i begin to love dogs .
what newspaper are you reading ?
of course , and i also like the rhythms .
really . it's worth listening to and enjoying .
hi , ben . here are the top ten of this week's top chart .
which is your favorite in this ten ?
what do you think of the novel you just finished reading ?
it's kind of cool that they are still using the same star wars theme song for this movie .
is it ? i've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
where is pamela ?
if i were her , i wouldn't marry a man i don't really love .
fine .
hello !
it's nice meeting you too , alice .
man , they take a lot of our paycheck .
seriously . the only tax i don't mind them taking is social security . it's only a few dollars every paycheck .
what did the doctor say ?
hey , let's eat out tonight .
did you get caught in the bad storm ?
oh , my ! it's really hot . i've never seen such scorching weather in my life .
oh , look at the thermometer ! the temperature has hit 98 .
i hope it stays like this .
how much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? you must have to keep it well below zero .
do you know what the temperature is today ?
it feels like ten degrees below zero at least . i don't mind the cold weather but i do hate it when it gets slippery .
lily , do you know lizzy ?
sorry , mr . polly .
actually i have a passion for chinese literature .
you ’ re a wonderful person , kathleen .
hi , david ! what are you doing ?
yes , he ’ s a millionaire in houston now .
do you think of television though as a great time waster ?
how about tomorrow afternoon ?
hey , susie , what health club do you belong to ?
what position do you play ?
have you seen harry ?
how are your parents these days ?
hey , look at my new shirt . what do you think about it ?
do you often go to watch sports games ?
ok , i guess it's worthy of two yuan .
what a pity ! i know you've been longing for it these months .
so did you get in touch with your brother ?
well , speak of the devil .
i hear you're moving to new york .
let's keep in touch .
one less car on the road means less pollution .
true . how much did you pay ?
man , that sunset is beautiful . i ’ ve never seen one so red .
really ?
i see . the fall in beijing is really beautiful .
it takes a long time to learn chinese writing .
it must have been love at first sight because i know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week .
so , what did you do out there ? i mean besides bask in the sun , obviously .
does bullfight interest you much ?
oh , that's very nice of you . i don't want to sound pushy , but i still l have one more question .
what's the date today ?
oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . that's where many of them learned to play the flute .
it's saturday . could you make the time ?
i ’ ll have the leg of lamb .
oh , how interesting . and what about larry and rocky ?
mom ?
see , i just told you he hit a deer . man , i knew you weren ’ t listening to me .
out ? what do you mean out ?
you mean this is going to be a regular thing ?
your bag ? did you get it back ?
if the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow .
thank you for your letter .
i'm sorry , sir . this is not a full service gas station . i will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
but this is terrible . i'm expecting important calls .
we need to talk .
tim , you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh , i could say that i ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . i know i ’ d only hurt you , i know i ’ d only make you cry .
what are you doing ?
how old is he today ?
sounds that way . maybe some other time then ?
likewise . see you later .
shall we go to cinema this evening ? the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . it ’ s supposed to be really good .
how would you solve the problem ?
good morning . i ’ m from the new york book review . could i ask you some question about your latest book ?
i don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they ’ re overpaid , over ambitious , and over adored .
i actually try to avoid name brand items . i can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !
to be honest , i didn't really like shaun of the dead . besides , i like movies with a happy ending best .
which language do you speak ?
that certainly sounds like a dreary saturday .
hey nick , what are you up to ?
i ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat .
mumm . no .
what's the weather forecast for today ?
very well , thanks . nice to see you again . i haven't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ?
thanks . and how are your parents ?
listen , karen , i need your help . i don't know anyone here yet .
and so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . thank you very much for your time .
ok , that ’ s fine . bye .
i want to know where this relationship is going . i ’ m in love with you and i need to know .
how can it be cliche ? it ’ s a fable ! it ’ s telling a time honoured story ! the movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .
you heard it folks ! it ’ s gonna be a cold one !
the ref signals the start of the game and here we go . ribero serves and china quickly receives the ball . chen bumps it to the setter , and . a very nice set by chen !
yeah , i know . but you ? i always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth .
don't believe what you see on tv . you will have a good time in new york . what things do you want to see ?
honey , seriously , it ’ s just a sheep . relax !
tom ! how are you ? we missed you at the party last night . are you ok ?
who are those guys ?
wow ! isn ’ t that dangerous ?
cool , give me a pint of heineken and half a pint of bud .
you mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?
i can't see him . where ?
okay .
yes . i think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . it is a kind of destruction of nature .
of course i miss grandma , too . i bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play mahjong ! hey , dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? we ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! i ’ m really looking forward to lighting them !
i can ’ t believe that anthony is finally getting married !
i know . our train system is lousy . and besides , americans love their cars too much .
it's good to have business around . but you should also do some exercise to keep fit .
but for what reasons ? she doesn't even know who i am .
how do you usually get to school ?
the more , the merrier !
there's just going to be 6 of us tonight .
what are you doing ?
likewise . see you later .
the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't .
yes . in fact , maybe we could go together .
i'll let you know . did you want to watch some tv ?
is that right ? it sure beats the old one ?
oh , tibet sounds great , but i'm afraid it'll cost too much . last time i traveled to india , and it cost me a fortune .
come on . a trip will do you good . are you doing anything this weekend ?
well , that's something i've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty .
excuse me , is this the way to the greta wall ?
it's a lovely day , isn't it ?
shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ?
i got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , i never brought another one .
what are you looking for ?
do you like ever chat online ?
that's really convenient . does it have the bluetooth ?
it quit working last week and i haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet .
how did your interview go ?
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
bring your own beverage . we can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks .
well , i work in the marketing department . the corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . before , when i was assigned a task , i was totally on my own but here most of the work is don
actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci fi or a suspense movie . how about you ?
bob ! your eyes look bloodshot . did you not sleep well ?
no , that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear , it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i've got a family t
you dance beautifully too .
seriously ? but you are such a genius .
there's a gym nearby ? that's exciting ! i really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . i've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .
what would it be like ?
i'm pretty good . i've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i don't want to renew it .
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ?
no , but i'm sure i'll get better soon .
my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in england .
what did you say ? how many ?
why have you been learning japanese ? why not english ?
it was a good game , wasn't it ?
i heard that you moved to florida .
oh , isn't your computer wi fi capable ?
what does mona like to do ?
come on ! three's a crowd !
i noticed that , it was not exciting as i expected , but the music was great . i'm always found jazz . and that movie had a lot of jazz .
when can you come ?
one thing's certain . if i had a lot of money , i wouldn't work any more .
a vet a veterinary surgeon .
i don't know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ?
no , there were too many people . when she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs .
are you good at making decisions ?
how do you spend your afternoons ?
no , thanks . i'm going home . my wife's expecting me .
ok , you could borrow one of mine .
do you believe in ufo's ?
i am sorry . i ’ ve left my disk at home .
mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ?
do you like this dress , madam ?
what ? you've got to be kidding me !
no , that's not mine .
he's a very nice person . we will all miss him .
would you like some more ?
i don ’ t want a mink coat ! i want to see the world .
but it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city .
mary ! i haven ’ t seen you since our dinner with mr . lee last week . where have you been hiding yourself lately ?
is this evening too soon ?
when you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , she must have a cow !
this is a precious opportunity for us and our company .
don't worry , your baby is in my home .
what do you do ?
don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
if china didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
you have to do something romantic .
it's not that difficult . if you want to watch a game with me , i can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching .
congratulations on the new house !
well , you guys work hard for it . it ’ s really beautiful .
yes , that was surprising . i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they're also one of the richest couples . they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
no , but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger .
i know this is going to sound sexist , but i don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
i think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
i heard that the return of the king was nominated for 11 oscars .
are your ready to go to the supermarket ?
i don't buy a story .
hi , jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? you can bring your girlfriend , tina .
your watch is ten minutes slow . so it's should be nine sharp . i'm gonna be late again . what will be my excuse this time ? it should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
hi , juliet , i'm treating mr . li and his team members from galp to dinner tomorrow evening . where do you think i should take them ?
hey , philip ! you won ’ t believe this !
hi , sally ! you are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl !
melissa ? i ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party .
if that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in laws !
who is cindy ’ s husband ?
do they have any grandchildren ?
he's fine . he retired last week . it's a turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike .
oh , i don't think you're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party .
do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
ok , then we'll go by train . i'm sure we'll have a good journey . shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
that sounds good .
could you tell me your education background ?
do you like cooking ?

why ?
you're from tangshan ? i can't believe my ears . i was also born in tangshan , but i was brought up in beijing .
nice to meet you too . melinda .
it looks like you guys work hard .
it ’ s the job i ’ m interested in . and your company is the best known . although i don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . it ’ s a job i ’ ve been dreaming of and i feel suited to fill it .
he is our accountant .
to start with , may i know why you are interested in working for our company ?
have you had any experience as a guide ?
what sports do you like best ?
according to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months .
excuse me . do you mind if i ask some things about work for this company ?
well , i need to confirm the time of their classes .
he has a mustache , if i remember correctly , and a light complexion .
we have the orientation this afternoon .
i've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . what time does our meeting start ? where is everyone anyway ?
listen , you can not afford another day off . you ’ ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks .
why ? you ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
after the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . so , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . what is your expected salary ?
well , we all get labour day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . it's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . i think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker .
good . do i have a second ?
what kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ?
what are you doing to increase understanding in the european sector ?
what time do you expect him back ?
i hate to trouble of you . but it is urgent . please leave this message into him
i am very impressed by your resume . therefore , i am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company .
how do you work with a team ?
thank you . actually , i could not believe it at first . you know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . many of them are qualified to fill that position .
i think you are looking at the wrong line . the rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . you are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . the one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . i think there was a problem in the marketing plan . some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales .
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .
the company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company id , batch , telephone , e mail set up and training .
yes , of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager .
what's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? we were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago . why haven't i heard anything about it ? did the whole project just vanish into thin air ?
managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . it includes all supervisors and department heads .
so , where can i start my work ?
what companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
i hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . there's nothing left . i'm so sorry .
are you kidding ?
do you have an appointment ?
yes , mr . mason , i just checked with our office manager , ms . terry , she said mr . smith briefed her on your project . she is just finishing up a meeting now . she could be with your shortly . would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
i take care of the letters . i may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
can you help me for a minute ?
you can double check with the housekeeping department , but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
this one ? this one is so light i can barely read it . how can that be ?
3000 rib as bonus for each person .
look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . i ’ ve pushed the start button . it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . what ’ s going on ?
tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
what are your strengths and weaknesses ?
what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ?
what degree will you receive ?
and i also want to know what the status is of the position .
it was always very busy there .
do you know exactly what you would be doing as a laboratory assistant ?
okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . i really want you to get this job !
interesting .
sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . how do you feel about that ?
what made you decide on this type of occupation ?
of course . as for an entry level accountant , we pay ¥ 1 , 500 a month in the first half year . we have a grading system to evaluate your work . if you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . for beginners with a cpa certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month .
tell me about yourself and your past experience .
do you get angry easily ?
that's a little more than we had planned .
i can only offer you 110 , 000 yuan a year . raises will be given after a three month probation according to your performance . is that satisfactory ?
how long do you plan to stay here ?
if you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the american market .
yes .
are you married ?
yeah , i'm very nauseous . it's mostly nausea and a fever .
then what is your opinion ?
i'm afraid .
could i have a word with you ?
what are you going to do ?
what are your salary expectations ?
are you interested in a full time or part time position ?
what are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ?
great . then what's your technical post title now ?
come on ! what have you got to lose ?
oh , yes . quite a bit . but we are especially interested in your products .
excuse me , i ’ m sorry to trouble you . my name is susan ransom , and i have placed several orders with you company .
i ’ m hoping you can sort a few things out for me . could you pull up my account ?
mr . division , i am so sorry to have kept you waiting .
when should i make my presence known ?
is there anything you want to ask about ?
i will talk about developing sales through our website . all the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff .
well , coffee isn't such a bad thing . everyone has to have something . for me , it's cigars . are you a cigar smoker ?
i know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . i'm aware of that .
i see . i will try my best to do the job well .
marketing manage office , can i help you ?
sorry , i am not sure , can i take a message ?
describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
hello , could i speak to allison , please ?
i need to get a flight to chicago on the 7th in the morning . can you give me a hand ?
i need to talk to you about that new secretary you ’ ve hired . i think i ’ m going to have some problems working with her .
then , mary . we need 10 more loose leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did i say ?
excuse me , mr . graham ? i have something i need to discuss with you .
greg . i want to speak to you for a minute .
well , i ’ ve got the spread sheets you asked for , but i ’ m still waiting on some data from accounting .
this is chris emerson speaking .
we give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . it sounds like a counter productive policy change to me .
i ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up .
i know i have what it takes but im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . should i inflate my experience ?
i ’ m ready to settle the bill .
the bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ ve charged you for the correct services . most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service .
goodness ! it ’ s been so long i actually forgot . let me see . yes , it is on my calendar .
that ’ s correct .
men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child .
that will be fine .

has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
i would like to make an appointment for a project meeting .

pilgrimages are common in many faiths .

probably . let's check the inside then .
how do we do timesheets here ?
i'm not quite sure .
yes , i understand the numbers .
i have no idea what the entertainment should be .
boy , this surely doesn't help us much . it could be anybody . how about his cloth ? what was he wearing .

i am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by .
what will that tell me ?
that being the case , i don ’ t think that i am going to show the income next time .
